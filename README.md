# Longtexts

A collection of long literary texts for the computational linguistics research purposes.

The texts are, as I believe, in the public domain. The texts have been obtained from Project Gutenberg, Wikisource, Royallib and lib.ru and preprocessed so as to fit specific research purposes:

- Copyright texts were removed from the files
- Author and translator notes were removed
- Table of contents and any indices were removed, except for the table of contents from Don Quixote
- Any links to illustrations have been removed
- In the Russian version of War and Peace any non-Russian text have been replaced with Russian translations
- Etymology was removed from Moby-Dick or, The Whale, where encountered, as some languages missed it
