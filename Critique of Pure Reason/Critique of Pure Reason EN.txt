preface to the first edition
human reason in one sphere of its cognition is called upon to consider questions which it cannot decline as they are presented by its own nature but which it cannot answer as they transcend every faculty of the mind
it falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own
it begins with principles which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience and the truth and sufficiency of which are at the same time insured by experience
with these principles it rises in obedience to the laws of its own nature to ever higher and more remote conditions
but it quickly discovers that in this way its labours must remain ever incomplete because new questions never cease to present themselves and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse to principles which transcend the region of experience while they are regarded by common sense without distrust
it thus falls into confusion and contradictions from which it conjectures the presence of latent errors which however it is unable to discover because the principles it employs transcending the limits of experience cannot be tested by that criterion
the arena of these endless contests is called metaphysic
time was when she was the queen of all the sciences and if we take the will for the deed she certainly deserves so far as regards the high importance of her objectmatter this title of honour
now it is the fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her and the matron mourns forlorn and forsaken like hecuba

at first her government under the administration of the dogmatists was an absolute despotism
but as the legislative continued to show traces of the ancient barbaric rule her empire gradually broke up and intestine wars introduced the reign of anarchy while the sceptics like nomadic tribes who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode of living attacked from time to time those who had organized themselves into civil communities
but their number was very happily small and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new edifices although on no settled or uniform plan
in recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those disputes settled and the legitimacy of her claims established by a kind of physiology of the human understandingthat of the celebrated locke
but it was found thatalthough it was affirmed that this socalled queen could not refer her descent to any higher source than that of common experience a circumstance which necessarily brought suspicion on her claimsas this genealogy was incorrect she persisted in the advancement of her claims to sovereignty
thus metaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rotten constitution of dogmatism and again became obnoxious to the contempt from which efforts had been made to save it
at present as all methods according to the general persuasion have been tried in vain there reigns nought but weariness and complete indifferentismthe mother of chaos and night in the scientific world but at the same time the source of or at least the prelude to the recreation and reinstallation of a science when it has fallen into confusion obscurity and disuse from ill directed effort
for it is in reality vain to profess indifference in regard to such inquiries the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity
besides these pretended indifferentists however much they may try to disguise themselves by the assumption of a popular style and by changes on the language of the schools unavoidably fall into metaphysical declarations and propositions which they profess to regard with so much contempt
at the same time this indifference which has arisen in the world of science and which relates to that kind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last is a phenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection
it is plainly not the effect of the levity but of the matured judgement of the age which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusory knowledge it is in fact a call to reason again to undertake the most laborious of all tasksthat of selfexamination and to establish a tribunal which may secure it in its wellgrounded claims while it pronounces against all baseless assumptions and pretensions not in an arbitrary manner but according to its own eternal and unchangeable laws
this tribunal is nothing less than the critical investigation of pure reason
we very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present age and of the decay of profound science
but i do not think that those which rest upon a secure foundation such as mathematics physical science etc
in the least deserve this reproach but that they rather maintain their ancient fame and in the latter case indeed far surpass it
the same would be the case with the other kinds of cognition if their principles were but firmly established
in the absence of this security indifference doubt and finally severe criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought
our age is the age of criticism to which everything must be subjected
the sacredness of religion and the authority of legislation are by many regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this tribunal
but if they are exempted they become the subjects of just suspicion and cannot lay claim to sincere respect which reason accords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public examination
i do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems but a critical inquiry into the faculty of reason with reference to the cognitions to which it strives to attain without the aid of experience in other words the solution of the question regarding the possibility or impossibility of metaphysics and the determination of the origin as well as of the extent and limits of this science
all this must be done on the basis of principles
this paththe only one now remaininghas been entered upon by me and i flatter myself that i have in this way discovered the cause ofand consequently the mode of removingall the errors which have hitherto set reason at variance with itself in the sphere of nonempirical thought
i have not returned an evasive answer to the questions of reason by alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties of the mind i have on the contrary examined them completely in the light of principles and after having discovered the cause of the doubts and contradictions into which reason fell have solved them to its perfect satisfaction
it is true these questions have not been solved as dogmatism in its vain fancies and desires had expected for it can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts and of these i have no knowledge
but neither do these come within the compass of our mental powers and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy the illusions which had their origin in misconceptions whatever darling hopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations
my chief aim in this work has been thoroughness and i make bold to say that there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find its solution or at least the key to its solution here
pure reason is a perfect unity and therefore if the principle presented by it prove to be insufficient for the solution of even a single one of those questions to which the very nature of reason gives birth we must reject it as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency in the case of the others
while i say this i think i see upon the countenance of the reader signs of dissatisfaction mingled with contempt when he hears declarations which sound so boastful and extravagant and yet they are beyond comparison more moderate than those advanced by the commonest author of the commonest philosophical programme in which the dogmatist professes to demonstrate the simple nature of the soul or the necessity of a primal being
such a dogmatist promises to extend human knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience while i humbly confess that this is completely beyond my power
instead of any such attempt i confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its pure thought and i do not need to seek far for the sumtotal of its cognition because it has its seat in my own mind
besides common logic presents me with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the simple operations of reason and it is my task to answer the question how far reason can go without the material presented and the aid furnished by experience
so much for the completeness and thoroughness necessary in the execution of the present task
the aims set before us are not arbitrarily proposed but are imposed upon us by the nature of cognition itself
the above remarks relate to the matter of our critical inquiry
as regards the form there are two indispensable conditions which any one who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of pure reason is bound to fulfil
these conditions are certitude and clearness
as regards certitude i have fully convinced myself that in this sphere of thought opinion is perfectly inadmissible and that everything which bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must be excluded as of no value in such discussions
for it is a necessary condition of every cognition that is to be established upon priori grounds that it shall be held to be absolutely necessary much more is this the case with an attempt to determine all pure priori cognition and to furnish the standardand consequently an exampleof all apodeictic philosophical certitude
whether i have succeeded in what i professed to do it is for the reader to determine it is the authors business merely to adduce grounds and reasons without determining what influence these ought to have on the mind of his judges
but lest anything he may have said may become the innocent cause of doubt in their minds or tend to weaken the effect which his arguments might otherwise producehe may be allowed to point out those passages which may occasion mistrust or difficulty although these do not concern the main purpose of the present work
he does this solely with the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts which might affect his judgement of the work as a whole and in regard to its ultimate aim
i know no investigations more necessary for a full insight into the nature of the faculty which we call understanding and at the same time for the determination of the rules and limits of its use than those undertaken in the second chapter of the transcendental analytic under the title of deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding and they have also cost me by far the greatest labourlabour which i hope will not remain uncompensated
the view there taken which goes somewhat deeply into the subject has two sides
the one relates to the objects of the pure understanding and is intended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the objective validity of its priori conceptions and it forms for this reason an essential part of the critique
the other considers the pure understanding itself its possibility and its powers of cognitionthat is from a subjective point of view and although this exposition is of great importance it does not belong essentially to the main purpose of the work because the grand question is what and how much can reason and understanding apart from experience cognize and not how is the faculty of thought itself possible as the latter is an inquiry into the cause of a given effect and has thus in it some semblance of an hypothesis although as i shall show on another occasion this is really not the fact it would seem that in the present instance i had allowed myself to enounce a mere opinion and that the reader must therefore be at liberty to hold a different opinion
but i beg to remind him that if my subjective deduction does not produce in his mind the conviction of its certitude at which i aimed the objective deduction with which alone the present work is properly concerned is in every respect satisfactory
as regards clearness the reader has a right to demand in the first place discursive or logical clearness that is on the basis of conceptions and secondly intuitive or sthetic clearness by means of intuitions that is by examples or other modes of illustration in concreto
i have done what i could for the first kind of intelligibility
this was essential to my purpose and it thus became the accidental cause of my inability to do complete justice to the second requirement
i have been almost always at a loss during the progress of this work how to settle this question
examples and illustrations always appeared to me necessary and in the first sketch of the critique naturally fell into their proper places
but i very soon became aware of the magnitude of my task and the numerous problems with which i should be engaged and as i perceived that this critical investigation would even if delivered in the driest scholastic manner be far from being brief i found it unadvisable to enlarge it still more with examples and explanations which are necessary only from a popular point of view
i was induced to take this course from the consideration also that the present work is not intended for popular use that those devoted to science do not require such helps although they are always acceptable and that they would have materially interfered with my present purpose
abb terrasson remarks with great justice that if we estimate the size of a work not from the number of its pages but from the time which we require to make ourselves master of it it may be said of many a bookthat it would be much shorter if it were not so short
on the other hand as regards the comprehensibility of a system of speculative cognition connected under a single principle we may say with equal justice many a book would have been much clearer if it had not been intended to be so very clear
for explanations and examples and other helps to intelligibility aid us in the comprehension of parts but they distract the attention dissipate the mental power of the reader and stand in the way of his forming a clear conception of the whole as he cannot attain soon enough to a survey of the system and the colouring and embellishments bestowed upon it prevent his observing its articulation or organizationwhich is the most important consideration with him when he comes to judge of its unity and stability
the reader must naturally have a strong inducement to cooperate with the present author if he has formed the intention of erecting a complete and solid edifice of metaphysical science according to the plan now laid before him
metaphysics as here represented is the only science which admits of completionand with little labour if it is united in a short time so that nothing will be left to future generations except the task of illustrating and applying it didactically
for this science is nothing more than the inventory of all that is given us by pure reason systematically arranged
nothing can escape our notice for what reason produces from itself cannot lie concealed but must be brought to the light by reason itself so soon as we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek
the perfect unity of this kind of cognitions which are based upon pure conceptions and uninfluenced by any empirical element or any peculiar intuition leading to determinate experience renders this completeness not only practicable but also necessary
tecum habita et nris quam sit tibi curta supellex

satirae iv
such a system of pure speculative reason i hope to be able to publish under the title of metaphysic of nature
the content of this work which will not be half so long will be very much richer than that of the present critique which has to discover the sources of this cognition and expose the conditions of its possibility and at the same time to clear and level a fit foundation for the scientific edifice
in the present work i look for the patient hearing and the impartiality of a judge in the other for the goodwill and assistance of a colabourer
for however complete the list of principles for this system may be in the critique the correctness of the system requires that no deduced conceptions should be absent
these cannot be presented priori but must be gradually discovered and while the synthesis of conceptions has been fully exhausted in the critique it is necessary that in the proposed work the same should be the case with their analysis
but this will be rather an amusement than a labour
in contradistinction to the metaphysic of ethics
this work was never published
preface to the second edition
whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies within the province of pure reason advances with that undeviating certainty which characterizes the progress of science we shall be at no loss to determine
if we find those who are engaged in metaphysical pursuits unable to come to an understanding as to the method which they ought to follow if we find them after the most elaborate preparations invariably brought to a stand before the goal is reached and compelled to retrace their steps and strike into fresh paths we may then feel quite sure that they are far from having attained to the certainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be merely groping about in the dark
in these circumstances we shall render an important service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the path along which it must travel in order to arrive at any resultseven if it should be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which without reflection have been proposed for its attainment
that logic has advanced in this sure course even from the earliest times is apparent from the fact that since aristotle it has been unable to advance a step and thus to all appearance has reached its completion
for if some of the moderns have thought to enlarge its domain by introducing psychological discussions on the mental faculties such as imagination and wit metaphysical discussions on the origin of knowledge and the different kinds of certitude according to the difference of the objects idealism scepticism and so on or anthropological discussions on prejudices their causes and remedies this attempt on the part of these authors only shows their ignorance of the peculiar nature of logical science
we do not enlarge but disfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limits and allow them to run into one another
now logic is enclosed within limits which admit of perfectly clear definition it is a science which has for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the formal laws of all thought whether it be priori or empirical whatever be its origin or its object and whatever the difficultiesnatural or accidentalwhich it encounters in the human mind
the early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to the narrowness of its field in which abstraction may or rather must be made of all the objects of cognition with their characteristic distinctions and in which the understanding has only to deal with itself and with its own forms
it is obviously a much more difficult task for reason to strike into the sure path of science where it has to deal not simply with itself but with objects external to itself
hence logic is properly only a propdeuticforms as it were the vestibule of the sciences and while it is necessary to enable us to form a correct judgement with regard to the various branches of knowledge still the acquisition of real substantive knowledge is to be sought only in the sciences properly so called that is in the objective sciences
now these sciences if they can be termed rational at all must contain elements of priori cognition and this cognition may stand in a twofold relation to its object
either it may have to determine the conception of the objectwhich must be supplied extraneously or it may have to establish its reality
the former is theoretical the latter practical rational cognition
in both the pure or priori element must be treated first and must be carefully distinguished from that which is supplied from other sources
any other method can only lead to irremediable confusion
mathematics and physics are the two theoretical sciences which have to determine their objects priori
the former is purely priori the latter is partially so but is also dependent on other sources of cognition
in the earliest times of which history affords us any record mathematics had already entered on the sure course of science among that wonderful nation the greeks
still it is not to be supposed that it was as easy for this science to strike into or rather to construct for itself that royal road as it was for logic in which reason has only to deal with itself
on the contrary i believe that it must have remained longchiefly among the egyptiansin the stage of blind groping after its true aims and destination and that it was revolutionized by the happy idea of one man who struck out and determined for all time the path which this science must follow and which admits of an indefinite advancement
the history of this intellectual revolutionmuch more important in its results than the discovery of the passage round the celebrated cape of good hopeand of its author has not been preserved
but diogenes laertius in naming the supposed discoverer of some of the simplest elements of geometrical demonstrationelements which according to the ordinary opinion do not even require to be provedmakes it apparent that the change introduced by the first indication of this new path must have seemed of the utmost importance to the mathematicians of that age and it has thus been secured against the chance of oblivion
a new light must have flashed on the mind of the first man thales or whatever may have been his name who demonstrated the properties of the isosceles triangle
for he found that it was not sufficient to meditate on the figure as it lay before his eyes or the conception of it as it existed in his mind and thus endeavour to get at the knowledge of its properties but that it was necessary to produce these properties as it were by a positive priori construction and that in order to arrive with certainty at priori cognition he must not attribute to the object any other properties than those which necessarily followed from that which he had himself in accordance with his conception placed in the object
a much longer period elapsed before physics entered on the highway of science
for it is only about a century and a half since the wise bacon gave a new direction to physical studies or ratheras others were already on the right trackimparted fresh vigour to the pursuit of this new direction
here too as in the case of mathematics we find evidence of a rapid intellectual revolution
in the remarks which follow i shall confine myself to the empirical side of natural science
when galilei experimented with balls of a definite weight on the inclined plane when torricelli caused the air to sustain a weight which he had calculated beforehand to be equal to that of a definite column of water or when stahl at a later period converted metals into lime and reconverted lime into metal by the addition and subtraction of certain elements a light broke upon all natural philosophers
they learned that reason only perceives that which it produces after its own design that it must not be content to follow as it were in the leadingstrings of nature but must proceed in advance with principles of judgement according to unvarying laws and compel nature to reply its questions
for accidental observations made according to no preconceived plan cannot be united under a necessary law
but it is this that reason seeks for and requires
it is only the principles of reason which can give to concordant phenomena the validity of laws and it is only when experiment is directed by these rational principles that it can have any real utility
reason must approach nature with the view indeed of receiving information from it not however in the character of a pupil who listens to all that his master chooses to tell him but in that of a judge who compels the witnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to propose
to this single idea must the revolution be ascribed by which after groping in the dark for so many centuries natural science was at length conducted into the path of certain progress
i do not here follow with exactness the history of the experimental method of which indeed the first steps are involved in some obscurity
we come now to metaphysics a purely speculative science which occupies a completely isolated position and is entirely independent of the teachings of experience
it deals with mere conceptionsnot like mathematics with conceptions applied to intuitionand in it reason is the pupil of itself alone
it is the oldest of the sciences and would still survive even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of an alldestroying barbarism
but it has not yet had the good fortune to attain to the sure scientific method
this will be apparent if we apply the tests which we proposed at the outset
we find that reason perpetually comes to a stand when it attempts to gain priori the perception even of those laws which the most common experience confirms
we find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerable instances and to abandon the path on which it had entered because this does not lead to the desired result
we find too that those who are engaged in metaphysical pursuits are far from being able to agree among themselves but that on the contrary this science appears to furnish an arena specially adapted for the display of skill or the exercise of strength in mockcontestsa field in which no combatant ever yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground in which at least no victory was ever yet crowned with permanent possession
this leads us to inquire why it is that in metaphysics the sure path of science has not hitherto been found
shall we suppose that it is impossible to discover it why then should nature have visited our reason with restless aspirations after it as if it were one of our weightiest concerns nay more how little cause should we have to place confidence in our reason if it abandons us in a matter about which most of all we desire to know the truthand not only so but even allures us to the pursuit of vain phantoms only to betray us in the end or if the path has only hitherto been missed what indications do we possess to guide us in a renewed investigation and to enable us to hope for greater success than has fallen to the lot of our predecessors
it appears to me that the examples of mathematics and natural philosophy which as we have seen were brought into their present condition by a sudden revolution are sufficiently remarkable to fix our attention on the essential circumstances of the change which has proved so advantageous to them and to induce us to make the experiment of imitating them so far as the analogy which as rational sciences they bear to metaphysics may permit
it has hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects but all attempts to ascertain anything about these objects priori by means of conceptions and thus to extend the range of our knowledge have been rendered abortive by this assumption
let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition
this appears at all events to accord better with the possibility of our gaining the end we have in view that is to say of arriving at the cognition of objects priori of determining something with respect to these objects before they are given to us
we here propose to do just what copernicus did in attempting to explain the celestial movements
when he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator he reversed the process and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved while the stars remained at rest
we may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects
if the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects i do not see how we can know anything of them priori
if on the other hand the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition i can then easily conceive the possibility of such an priori knowledge
now as i cannot rest in the mere intuitions butif they are to become cognitionsmust refer them as representations to something as object and must determine the latter by means of the former here again there are two courses open to me
either first i may assume that the conceptions by which i effect this determination conform to the objectand in this case i am reduced to the same perplexity as before or secondly i may assume that the objects or which is the same thing that experience in which alone as given objects they are cognized conform to my conceptionsand then i am at no loss how to proceed
for experience itself is a mode of cognition which requires understanding
before objects are given to me that is priori i must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which are expressed in conceptions priori
to these conceptions then all the objects of experience must necessarily conform
now there are objects which reason thinks and that necessarily but which cannot be given in experience or at least cannot be given so as reason thinks them
the attempt to think these objects will hereafter furnish an excellent test of the new method of thought which we have adopted and which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things priori that which we ourselves place in them
this method accordingly which we have borrowed from the natural philosopher consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in that which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment
now the propositions of pure reason especially when they transcend the limits of possible experience do not admit of our making any experiment with their objects as in natural science
hence with regard to those conceptions and principles which we assume priori our only course will be to view them from two different sides
we must regard one and the same conception on the one hand in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the understanding on the other hand in relation to reason isolated and transcending the limits of experience as an object of mere thought
now if we find that when we regard things from this double point of view the result is in harmony with the principle of pure reason but that when we regard them from a single point of view reason is involved in selfcontradiction then the experiment will establish the correctness of this distinction
this attempt succeeds as well as we could desire and promises to metaphysics in its first partthat is where it is occupied with conceptions priori of which the corresponding objects may be given in experiencethe certain course of science
for by this new method we are enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of priori cognition and what is more to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws which lie priori at the foundation of nature as the sum of the objects of experienceneither of which was possible according to the procedure hitherto followed
but from this deduction of the faculty of priori cognition in the first part of metaphysics we derive a surprising result and one which to all appearance militates against the great end of metaphysics as treated in the second part
for we come to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to transcend the limits of possible experience and yet this is precisely the most essential object of this science
the estimate of our rational cognition priori at which we arrive is that it has only to do with phenomena and that things in themselves while possessing a real existence lie beyond its sphere
here we are enabled to put the justice of this estimate to the test
for that which of necessity impels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is the unconditioned which reason absolutely requires in things as they are in themselves in order to complete the series of conditions
now if it appears that when on the one hand we assume that our cognition conforms to its objects as things in themselves the unconditioned cannot be thought without contradiction and that when on the other hand we assume that our representation of things as they are given to us does not conform to these things as they are in themselves but that these objects as phenomena conform to our mode of representation the contradiction disappears we shall then be convinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake of experiment we may look upon it as established that the unconditioned does not lie in things as we know them or as they are given to us but in things as they are in themselves beyond the range of our cognition
this experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of the chemists which they term the experiment of reduction or more usually the synthetic process
the analysis of the metaphysician separates pure cognition priori into two heterogeneous elements viz
the cognition of things as phenomena and of things in themselves
dialectic combines these again into harmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned and finds that this harmony never results except through the above distinction which is therefore concluded to be just
but after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make any progress in the sphere of the supersensible it still remains for our consideration whether data do not exist in practical cognition which may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the unconditioned to rise beyond the limits of all possible experience from a practical point of view and thus to satisfy the great ends of metaphysics
speculative reason has thus at least made room for such an extension of our knowledge and if it must leave this space vacant still it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up if we can by means of practical datanay it even challenges us to make the attempt
so the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies established the truth of that which copernicus first assumed only as a hypothesis and at the same time brought to light that invisible force newtonian attraction which holds the universe together
the latter would have remained forever undiscovered if copernicus had not ventured on the experimentcontrary to the senses but still justof looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies but in the spectator
in this preface i treat the new metaphysical method as a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at such a change of method which are always hypothetical
but in the critique itself it will be demonstrated not hypothetically but apodeictically from the nature of our representations of space and time and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding
this attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of metaphysics after the example of the geometricians and natural philosophers constitutes the aim of the critique of pure speculative reason
it is a treatise on the method to be followed not a system of the science itself
but at the same time it marks out and defines both the external boundaries and the internal structure of this science
for pure speculative reason has this peculiarity that in choosing the various objects of thought it is able to define the limits of its own faculties and even to give a complete enumeration of the possible modes of proposing problems to itself and thus to sketch out the entire system of metaphysics
for on the one hand in cognition priori nothing must be attributed to the objects but what the thinking subject derives from itself and on the other hand reason is in regard to the principles of cognition a perfectly distinct independent unity in which as in an organized body every member exists for the sake of the others and all for the sake of each so that no principle can be viewed with safety in one relationship unless it is at the same time viewed in relation to the total use of pure reason
hence too metaphysics has this singular advantagean advantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to do with objectsthat if once it is conducted into the sure path of science by means of this criticism it can then take in the whole sphere of its cognitions and can thus complete its work and leave it for the use of posterity as a capital which can never receive fresh accessions
for metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with the limitations of its own employment as determined by these principles
to this perfection it is therefore bound as the fundamental science to attain and to it the maxim may justly be applied
nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum
but it will be asked what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to bequeath to posterity what is the real value of this system of metaphysics purified by criticism and thereby reduced to a permanent condition a cursory view of the present work will lead to the supposition that its use is merely negative that it only serves to warn us against venturing with speculative reason beyond the limits of experience
this is in fact its primary use
but this at once assumes a positive value when we observe that the principles with which speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits lead inevitably not to the extension but to the contraction of the use of reason inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits of sensibility which is their proper sphere over the entire realm of thought and thus to supplant the pure practical use of reason
so far then as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative reason within its proper bounds it is only negative but inasmuch as it thereby at the same time removes an obstacle which impedes and even threatens to destroy the use of practical reason it possesses a positive and very important value
in order to admit this we have only to be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of pure reasonthe moral usein which it inevitably transcends the limits of sensibility without the aid of speculation requiring only to be insured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it in contradiction with itself
to deny the positive advantage of the service which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to maintain that the system of police is productive of no positive benefit since its main business is to prevent the violence which citizen has to apprehend from citizen that so each may pursue his vocation in peace and security
that space and time are only forms of sensible intuition and hence are only conditions of the existence of things as phenomena that moreover we have no conceptions of the understanding and consequently no elements for the cognition of things except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to these conceptions that accordingly we can have no cognition of an object as a thing in itself but only as an object of sensible intuition that is as phenomenonall this is proved in the analytical part of the critique and from this the limitation of all possible speculative cognition to the mere objects of experience follows as a necessary result
at the same time it must be carefully borne in mind that while we surrender the power of cognizing we still reserve the power of thinking objects as things in themselves
for otherwise we should require to affirm the existence of an appearance without something that appearswhich would be absurd
now let us suppose for a moment that we had not undertaken this criticism and accordingly had not drawn the necessary distinction between things as objects of experience and things as they are in themselves
the principle of causality and by consequence the mechanism of nature as determined by causality would then have absolute validity in relation to all things as efficient causes
i should then be unable to assert with regard to one and the same being e
g
the human soul that its will is free and yet at the same time subject to natural necessity that is not free without falling into a palpable contradiction for in both propositions i should take the soul in the same signification as a thing in general as a thing in itselfas without previous criticism i could not but take it
suppose now on the other hand that we have undertaken this criticism and have learnt that an object may be taken in two senses first as a phenomenon secondly as a thing in itself and that according to the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding the principle of causality has reference only to things in the first sense
we then see how it does not involve any contradiction to assert on the one hand that the will in the phenomenal spherein visible actionis necessarily obedient to the law of nature and in so far not free and on the other hand that as belonging to a thing in itself it is not subject to that law and accordingly is free
now it is true that i cannot by means of speculative reason and still less by empirical observation cognize my soul as a thing in itself and consequently cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being to which i ascribe effects in the world of sense
for to do so i must cognize this being as existing and yet not in time whichsince i cannot support my conception by any intuitionis impossible
at the same time while i cannot cognize i can quite well think freedom that is to say my representation of it involves at least no contradiction if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two modes of representation the sensible and the intellectual and the consequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and of the principles which flow from them
suppose now that morality necessarily presupposed liberty in the strictest sense as a property of our will suppose that reason contained certain practical original principles priori which were absolutely impossible without this presupposition and suppose at the same time that speculative reason had proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all
it would then follow that the moral presupposition must give way to the speculative affirmation the opposite of which involves an obvious contradiction and that liberty and with it morality must yield to the mechanism of nature for the negation of morality involves no contradiction except on the presupposition of liberty
now morality does not require the speculative cognition of liberty it is enough that i can think it that its conception involves no contradiction that it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature
but even this requirement we could not satisfy if we had not learnt the twofold sense in which things may be taken and it is only in this way that the doctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are confined within their proper limits
for this result then we are indebted to a criticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to things in themselves and establishes the necessary limitation of our theoretical cognition to mere phenomena
in order to cognize an object i must be able to prove its possibility either from its reality as attested by experience or priori by means of reason
but i can think what i please provided only i do not contradict myself that is provided my conception is a possible thought though i may be unable to answer for the existence of a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities
but something more is required before i can attribute to such a conception objective validity that is real possibilitythe other possibility being merely logical
we are not however confined to theoretical sources of cognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement but may derive them from practical sources
the positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in relation to the conception of god and of the simple nature of the soul admits of a similar exemplification but on this point i shall not dwell
i cannot even make the assumptionas the practical interests of morality requireof god freedom and immortality if i do not deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight
for to arrive at these it must make use of principles which in fact extend only to the objects of possible experience and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into phenomena and thus rendering the practical extension of pure reason impossible
i must therefore abolish knowledge to make room for belief
the dogmatism of metaphysics that is the presumption that it is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism is the true source of the unbelief always dogmatic which militates against morality
thus while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to posterity in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in accordance with the critique of pure reason still the value of such a bequest is not to be depreciated
it will render an important service to reason by substituting the certainty of scientific method for that random groping after results without the guidance of principles which has hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies
it will render an important service to the inquiring mind of youth by leading the student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science instead of wasting them as at present on speculations which can never lead to any result or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and opinions
but above all it will confer an inestimable benefit on morality and religion by showing that all the objections urged against them may be silenced for ever by the socratic method that is to say by proving the ignorance of the objector
for as the world has never been and no doubt never will be without a system of metaphysics of one kind or another it is the highest and weightiest concern of philosophy to render it powerless for harm by closing up the sources of error
this important change in the field of the sciences this loss of its fancied possessions to which speculative reason must submit does not prove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity
the advantages which the world has derived from the teachings of pure reason are not at all impaired
the loss falls in its whole extent on the monopoly of the schools but does not in the slightest degree touch the interests of mankind
i appeal to the most obstinate dogmatist whether the proof of the continued existence of the soul after death derived from the simplicity of its substance of the freedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and objective practical necessity or of the existence of god deduced from the conception of an ens realissimumthe contingency of the changeable and the necessity of a prime mover has ever been able to pass beyond the limits of the schools to penetrate the public mind or to exercise the slightest influence on its convictions
it must be admitted that this has not been the case and that owing to the unfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations it can never be expected to take place
on the contrary it is plain that the hope of a future life arises from the feeling which exists in the breast of every man that the temporal is inadequate to meet and satisfy the demands of his nature
in like manner it cannot be doubted that the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of inclination gives rise to the consciousness of freedom and that the glorious order beauty and providential care everywhere displayed in nature give rise to the belief in a wise and great author of the universe
such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind so far as they depend on rational grounds and this public property not only remains undisturbed but is even raised to greater importance by the doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a more profound insight into a matter of general human concernment than that to which the great mass of men ever held by us in the highest estimation can without difficulty attain and that the schools should therefore confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally comprehensible and from a moral point of view amply satisfactory proofs
the change therefore affects only the arrogant pretensions of the schools which would gladly retain in their own exclusive possession the key to the truths which they impart to the public
quod mecum nescit solus vult scire videri
at the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his just title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the public without its knowledgei mean the critique of pure reason
this can never become popular and indeed has no occasion to be so for finespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little impression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought against these truths
on the other hand since both inevitably force themselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation it becomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thorough investigation of the rights of speculative reason and thus to prevent the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure sooner or later to cause even to the masses
it is only by criticism that metaphysicians and as such theologians too can be saved from these controversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines
criticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism fatalism atheism freethinking fanaticism and superstition which are universally injuriousas well as of idealism and scepticism which are dangerous to the schools but can scarcely pass over to the public
if governments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of science as well as for those of society to favour a criticism of this kind by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm basis than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools which raise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of cobwebs of which the public has never taken any notice and the loss of which therefore it can never feel
this critical science is not opposed to the dogmatic procedure of reason in pure cognition for pure cognition must always be dogmatic that is must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles prioribut to dogmatism that is to the presumption that it is possible to make any progress with a pure cognition derived from philosophical conceptions according to the principles which reason has long been in the habit of employingwithout first inquiring in what way and by what right reason has come into the possession of these principles
dogmatism is thus the dogmatic procedure of pure reason without previous criticism of its own powers and in opposing this procedure we must not be supposed to lend any countenance to that loquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name of popularity nor yet to scepticism which makes short work with the whole science of metaphysics
on the contrary our criticism is the necessary preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysics which must perform its task entirely priori to the complete satisfaction of speculative reason and must therefore be treated not popularly but scholastically
in carrying out the plan which the critique prescribes that is in the future system of metaphysics we must have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated wolf the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers
he was the first to point out the necessity of establishing fixed principles of clearly defining our conceptions and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severe scrutiny instead of rashly jumping at conclusions
the example which he set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thorough investigation which is not yet extinct in germany
he would have been peculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to metaphysical studies had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a criticism of the organum that is of pure reason itself
that he failed to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribed to the dogmatic mode of thought which characterized his age and on this point the philosophers of his time as well as of all previous times have nothing to reproach each other with
those who reject at once the method of wolf and of the critique of pure reason can have no other aim but to shake off the fetters of science to change labour into sport certainty into opinion and philosophy into philodoxy
in this second edition i have endeavoured as far as possible to remove the difficulties and obscurity which without fault of mine perhaps have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute thinkers
in the propositions themselves and in the demonstrations by which they are supported as well as in the form and the entire plan of the work i have found nothing to alter which must be attributed partly to the long examination to which i had subjected the whole before offering it to the public and partly to the nature of the case
for pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there is nothing isolated or independent but every single part is essential to all the rest and hence the slightest imperfection whether defect or positive error could not fail to betray itself in use
i venture further to hope that this system will maintain the same unalterable character for the future
i am led to entertain this confidence not by vanity but by the evidence which the equality of the result affords when we proceed first from the simplest elements up to the complete whole of pure reason and and then backwards from the whole to each part
we find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration in any part leads inevitably to contradictions not merely in this system but in human reason itself
at the same time there is still much room for improvement in the exposition of the doctrines contained in this work
in the present edition i have endeavoured to remove misapprehensions of the sthetical part especially with regard to the conception of time to clear away the obscurity which has been found in the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding to supply the supposed want of sufficient evidence in the demonstration of the principles of the pure understanding and lastly to obviate the misunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede the rational psychology
beyond this pointthe end of the second main division of the transcendental dialectici have not extended my alterations partly from want of time and partly because i am not aware that any portion of the remainder has given rise to misconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics whom i do not here mention with that praise which is their due but who will find that their suggestions have been attended to in the work itself
the only addition properly so calledand that only in the method of proofwhich i have made in the present edition consists of a new refutation of psychological idealism and a strict demonstrationthe only one possible as i believeof the objective reality of external intuition
however harmless idealism may be consideredalthough in reality it is not soin regard to the essential ends of metaphysics it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human reason to be obliged to assume as an article of mere belief the existence of things external to ourselves from which yet we derive the whole material of cognition for the internal sense and not to be able to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in question
as there is some obscurity of expression in the demonstration as it stands in the text i propose to alter the passage in question as follows but this permanent cannot be an intuition in me
for all the determining grounds of my existence which can be found in me are representations and as such do themselves require a permanent distinct from them which may determine my existence in relation to their changes that is my existence in time wherein they change
it may probably be urged in opposition to this proof that after all i am only conscious immediately of that which is in me that is of my representation of external things and that consequently it must always remain uncertain whether anything corresponding to this representation does or does not exist externally to me
but i am conscious through internal experience of my existence in time consequently also of the determinability of the former in the latter and that is more than the simple consciousness of my representation
it is in fact the same as the empirical consciousness of my existence which can only be determined in relation to something which while connected with my existence is external to me
this consciousness of my existence in time is therefore identical with the consciousness of a relation to something external to me and it is therefore experience not fiction sense not imagination which inseparably connects the external with my internal sense
for the external sense is in itself the relation of intuition to something real external to me and the reality of this something as opposed to the mere imagination of it rests solely on its inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition of its possibility
if with the intellectual consciousness of my existence in the representation i am which accompanies all my judgements and all the operations of my understanding i could at the same time connect a determination of my existence by intellectual intuition then the consciousness of a relation to something external to me would not be necessary
but the internal intuition in which alone my existence can be determined though preceded by that purely intellectual consciousness is itself sensible and attached to the condition of time
hence this determination of my existence and consequently my internal experience itself must depend on something permanent which is not in me which can be therefore only in something external to me to which i must look upon myself as being related
thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily connected with that of the internal in order to the possibility of experience in general that is i am just as certainly conscious that there are things external to me related to my sense as i am that i myself exist as determined in time
but in order to ascertain to what given intuitions objects external me really correspond in other words what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to imagination i must have recourse in every particular case to those rules according to which experience in general even internal experience is distinguished from imagination and which are always based on the proposition that there really is an external experience
we may add the remark that the representation of something permanent in existence is not the same thing as the permanent representation for a representation may be very variable and changingas all our representations even that of matter areand yet refer to something permanent which must therefore be distinct from all my representations and external to me the existence of which is necessarily included in the determination of my own existence and with it constitutes one experiencean experience which would not even be possible internally if it were not also at the same time in part external
to the question how we are no more able to reply than we are in general to think the stationary in time the coexistence of which with the variable produces the conception of change
in attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as possible i have been compelled to leave out or abridge various passages which were not essential to the completeness of the work but which many readers might consider useful in other respects and might be unwilling to miss
this trifling loss which could not be avoided without swelling the book beyond due limits may be supplied at the pleasure of the reader by a comparison with the first edition and will i hope be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of the exposition as it now stands
i have observed with pleasure and thankfulness in the pages of various reviews and treatises that the spirit of profound and thorough investigation is not extinct in germany though it may have been overborne and silenced for a time by the fashionable tone of a licence in thinking which gives itself the airs of genius and that the difficulties which beset the paths of criticism have not prevented energetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters of the science of pure reason to which these paths conducta science which is not popular but scholastic in its character and which alone can hope for a lasting existence or possess an abiding value
to these deserving men who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucid expositiona talent which i myself am not conscious of possessingi leave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to the statement of my doctrines
for in this case the danger is not that of being refuted but of being misunderstood
for my own part i must henceforward abstain from controversy although i shall carefully attend to all suggestions whether from friends or adversaries which may be of use in the future elaboration of the system of this propdeutic
as during these labours i have advanced pretty far in years this month i reach my sixtyfourth yearit will be necessary for me to economize time if i am to carry out my plan of elaborating the metaphysics of nature as well as of morals in confirmation of the correctness of the principles established in this critique of pure reason both speculative and practical and i must therefore leave the task of clearing up the obscurities of the present workinevitable perhaps at the outsetas well as the defence of the whole to those deserving men who have made my system their own
a philosophical system cannot come forward armed at all points like a mathematical treatise and hence it may be quite possible to take objection to particular passages while the organic structure of the system considered as a unity has no danger to apprehend
but few possess the ability and still fewer the inclination to take a comprehensive view of a new system
by confining the view to particular passages taking these out of their connection and comparing them with one another it is easy to pick out apparent contradictions especially in a work written with any freedom of style
these contradictions place the work in an unfavourable light in the eyes of those who rely on the judgement of others but are easily reconciled by those who have mastered the idea of the whole
if a theory possesses stability in itself the action and reaction which seemed at first to threaten its existence serve only in the course of time to smooth down any superficial roughness or inequality andif men of insight impartiality and truly popular gifts turn their attention to itto secure to it in a short time the requisite elegance also

introduction
i
of the difference between pure and empirical knowledge
that all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt
for how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our senses and partly of themselves produce representations partly rouse our powers of understanding into activity to compare to connect or to separate these and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects which is called experience in respect of time therefore no knowledge of ours is antecedent to experience but begins with it
but though all our knowledge begins with experience it by no means follows that all arises out of experience
for on the contrary it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given by sense till long practice has made us attentive to and skilful in separating it
it is therefore a question which requires close investigation and not to be answered at first sight whether there exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience and even of all sensuous impressions knowledge of this kind is called priori in contradistinction to empirical knowledge which has its sources posteriori that is in experience
but the expression priori is not as yet definite enough adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started
for in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience we are wont to say that this or that may be known priori because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience but from a general rule which however we have itself borrowed from experience
thus if a man undermined his house we say he might know priori that it would have fallen that is he needed not to have waited for the experience that it did actually fall
but still priori he could not know even this much
for that bodies are heavy and consequently that they fall when their supports are taken away must have been known to him previously by means of experience
by the term knowledge priori therefore we shall in the sequel understand not such as is independent of this or that kind of experience but such as is absolutely so of all experience
opposed to this is empirical knowledge or that which is possible only posteriori that is through experience
knowledge priori is either pure or impure
pure knowledge priori is that with which no empirical element is mixed up
for example the proposition every change has a cause is a proposition priori but impure because change is a conception which can only be derived from experience
ii
the human intellect even in an unphilosophical state is in possession of certain cognitions priori
the question now is as to a criterion by which we may securely distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition
experience no doubt teaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a manner but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise
now in the first place if we have a proposition which contains the idea of necessity in its very conception it is priori
if moreover it is not derived from any other proposition unless from one equally involving the idea of necessity it is absolutely priori
secondly an empirical judgement never exhibits strict and absolute but only assumed and comparative universality by induction therefore the most we can say isso far as we have hitherto observed there is no exception to this or that rule
if on the other hand a judgement carries with it strict and absolute universality that is admits of no possible exception it is not derived from experience but is valid absolutely priori
empirical universality is therefore only an arbitrary extension of validity from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in most cases to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good in all as for example in the affirmation all bodies are heavy
when on the contrary strict universality characterizes a judgement it necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge namely a faculty of cognition priori
necessity and strict universality therefore are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical knowledge and are inseparably connected with each other
but as in the use of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easily detected than the contingency of the judgement or the unlimited universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing proof than its necessity it may be advisable to use the criteria separately each being by itself infallible
now that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are necessary and in the strictest sense universal consequently pure priori it will be an easy matter to show
if we desire an example from the sciences we need only take any proposition in mathematics
if we cast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding the proposition every change must have a cause will amply serve our purpose
in the latter case indeed the conception of a cause so plainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an effect and of a strict universality of the law that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear were we to derive it like hume from a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes and the habit thence originating of connecting representationsthe necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective
besides without seeking for such examples of principles existing priori in cognition we might easily show that such principles are the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself and consequently prove their existence priori
for whence could our experience itself acquire certainty if all the rules on which it depends were themselves empirical and consequently fortuitous no one therefore can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first principles
but for the present we may content ourselves with having established the fact that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure priori cognition and secondly with having pointed out the proper tests of such cognition namely universality and necessity
not only in judgements however but even in conceptions is an priori origin manifest
for example if we take away by degrees from our conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous experiencecolour hardness or softness weight even impenetrabilitythe body will then vanish but the space which it occupied still remains and this it is utterly impossible to annihilate in thought
again if we take away in like manner from our empirical conception of any object corporeal or incorporeal all properties which mere experience has taught us to connect with it still we cannot think away those through which we cogitate it as substance or adhering to substance although our conception of substance is more determined than that of an object
compelled therefore by that necessity with which the conception of substance forces itself upon us we must confess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition priori
iii
philosophy stands in need of a science which shall determine the possibility principles and extent of human knowledge priori
of far more importance than all that has been above said is the consideration that certain of our cognitions rise completely above the sphere of all possible experience and by means of conceptions to which there exists in the whole extent of experience no corresponding object seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds
and just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere where experience affords us neither instruction nor guidance lie the investigations of reason which on account of their importance we consider far preferable to and as having a far more elevated aim than all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous phenomena
so high a value do we set upon these investigations that even at the risk of error we persist in following them out and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the pursuit
these unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are god freedom of will and immortality
the science which with all its preliminaries has for its especial object the solution of these problems is named metaphysicsa science which is at the very outset dogmatical that is it confidently takes upon itself the execution of this task without any previous investigation of the ability or inability of reason for such an undertaking
now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned it seems nevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with the cognitions we possess without knowing whence they come and on the strength of principles the origin of which is undiscovered
instead of thus trying to build without a foundation it is rather to be expected that we should long ago have put the question how the understanding can arrive at these priori cognitions and what is the extent validity and worth which they may possess we say this is natural enough meaning by the word natural that which is consistent with a just and reasonable way of thinking but if we understand by the term that which usually happens nothing indeed could be more natural and more comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long unattempted
for one part of our pure knowledge the science of mathematics has been long firmly established and thus leads us to form flattering expectations with regard to others though these may be of quite a different nature
besides when we get beyond the bounds of experience we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter and the charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that unless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction we hurry on undoubtingly in our course
this however may be avoided if we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions which are not the less fictions on that account
mathematical science affords us a brilliant example how far independently of all experience we may carry our priori knowledge
it is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects and cognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means of intuition
but this circumstance is easily overlooked because the said intuition can itself be given priori and therefore is hardly to be distinguished from a mere pure conception
deceived by such a proof of the power of reason we can perceive no limits to the extension of our knowledge
the light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air whose resistance it feels might imagine that her movements would be far more free and rapid in airless space
just in the same way did plato abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to the understanding venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it into the void space of pure intellect
he did not reflect that he made no real progress by all his efforts for he met with no resistance which might serve him for a support as it were whereon to rest and on which he might apply his powers in order to let the intellect acquire momentum for its progress
it is indeed the common fate of human reason in speculation to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as possible and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the foundation is a solid one or no
arrived at this point all sorts of excuses are sought after in order to console us for its want of stability or rather indeed to enable us to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous an investigation
but what frees us during the process of building from all apprehension or suspicion and flatters us into the belief of its solidity is this
a great part perhaps the greatest part of the business of our reason consists in the analysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects
by this means we gain a multitude of cognitions which although really nothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which though in a confused manner was already thought in our conceptions are at least in respect of their form prized as new introspections whilst so far as regards their matter or content we have really made no addition to our conceptions but only disinvolved them
but as this process does furnish a real priori knowledge which has a sure progress and useful results reason deceived by this slips in without being itself aware of it assertions of a quite different kind in which to given conceptions it adds others priori indeed but entirely foreign to them without our knowing how it arrives at these and indeed without such a question ever suggesting itself
i shall therefore at once proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of knowledge
iv
of the difference between analytical and synthetical judgements
in all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is cogitated i mention affirmative judgements only here the application to negative will be very easy this relation is possible in two different ways
either the predicate b belongs to the subject a as somewhat which is contained though covertly in the conception a or the predicate b lies completely out of the conception a although it stands in connection with it
in the first instance i term the judgement analytical in the second synthetical
analytical judgements affirmative are therefore those in which the connection of the predicate with the subject is cogitated through identity those in which this connection is cogitated without identity are called synthetical judgements
the former may be called explicative the latter augmentative judgements because the former add in the predicate nothing to the conception of the subject but only analyse it into its constituent conceptions which were thought already in the subject although in a confused manner the latter add to our conceptions of the subject a predicate which was not contained in it and which no analysis could ever have discovered therein
for example when i say all bodies are extended this is an analytical judgement
for i need not go beyond the conception of body in order to find extension connected with it but merely analyse the conception that is become conscious of the manifold properties which i think in that conception in order to discover this predicate in it it is therefore an analytical judgement
on the other hand when i say all bodies are heavy the predicate is something totally different from that which i think in the mere conception of a body
by the addition of such a predicate therefore it becomes a synthetical judgement
judgements of experience as such are always synthetical
for it would be absurd to think of grounding an analytical judgement on experience because in forming such a judgement i need not go out of the sphere of my conceptions and therefore recourse to the testimony of experience is quite unnecessary
that bodies are extended is not an empirical judgement but a proposition which stands firm priori
for before addressing myself to experience i already have in my conception all the requisite conditions for the judgement and i have only to extract the predicate from the conception according to the principle of contradiction and thereby at the same time become conscious of the necessity of the judgement a necessity which i could never learn from experience
on the other hand though at first i do not at all include the predicate of weight in my conception of body in general that conception still indicates an object of experience a part of the totality of experience to which i can still add other parts and this i do when i recognize by observation that bodies are heavy
i can cognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through the characteristics of extension impenetrability shape etc
all which are cogitated in this conception
but now i extend my knowledge and looking back on experience from which i had derived this conception of body i find weight at all times connected with the above characteristics and therefore i synthetically add to my conceptions this as a predicate and say all bodies are heavy
thus it is experience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of weight with the conception of body because both conceptions although the one is not contained in the other still belong to one another only contingently however as parts of a whole namely of experience which is itself a synthesis of intuitions
but to synthetical judgements priori such aid is entirely wanting
if i go out of and beyond the conception a in order to recognize another b as connected with it what foundation have i to rest on whereby to render the synthesis possible i have here no longer the advantage of looking out in the sphere of experience for what i want
let us take for example the proposition everything that happens has a cause
in the conception of something that happens i indeed think an existence which a certain time antecedes and from this i can derive analytical judgements
but the conception of a cause lies quite out of the above conception and indicates something entirely different from that which happens and is consequently not contained in that conception
how then am i able to assert concerning the general conceptionthat which happenssomething entirely different from that conception and to recognize the conception of cause although not contained in it yet as belonging to it and even necessarily what is here the unknown x upon which the understanding rests when it believes it has found out of the conception a a foreign predicate b which it nevertheless considers to be connected with it it cannot be experience because the principle adduced annexes the two representations cause and effect to the representation existence not only with universality which experience cannot give but also with the expression of necessity therefore completely priori and from pure conceptions
upon such synthetical that is augmentative propositions depends the whole aim of our speculative knowledge priori for although analytical judgements are indeed highly important and necessary they are so only to arrive at that clearness of conceptions which is requisite for a sure and extended synthesis and this alone is a real acquisition
v
in all theoretical sciences of reason synthetical judgements priori are contained as principles
mathematical judgements are always synthetical
hitherto this fact though incontestably true and very important in its consequences seems to have escaped the analysts of the human mind nay to be in complete opposition to all their conjectures
for as it was found that mathematical conclusions all proceed according to the principle of contradiction which the nature of every apodeictic certainty requires people became persuaded that the fundamental principles of the science also were recognized and admitted in the same way
but the notion is fallacious for although a synthetical proposition can certainly be discerned by means of the principle of contradiction this is possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes from which the latter is deduced but never of itself
before all be it observed that proper mathematical propositions are always judgements priori and not empirical because they carry along with them the conception of necessity which cannot be given by experience
if this be demurred to it matters not i will then limit my assertion to pure mathematics the very conception of which implies that it consists of knowledge altogether nonempirical and priori
we might indeed at first suppose that the proposition is a merely analytical proposition following according to the principle of contradiction from the conception of a sum of seven and five
but if we regard it more narrowly we find that our conception of the sum of seven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sums into one whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number is which embraces both
the conception of twelve is by no means obtained by merely cogitating the union of seven and five and we may analyse our conception of such a possible sum as long as we will still we shall never discover in it the notion of twelve
we must go beyond these conceptions and have recourse to an intuition which corresponds to one of the twoour five fingers for example or like segner in his arithmetic five points and so by degrees add the units contained in the five given in the intuition to the conception of seven
for i first take the number and for the conception of calling in the aid of the fingers of my hand as objects of intuition i add the units which i before took together to make up the number gradually now by means of the material image my hand to the number and by this process i at length see the number arise
that should be added to i have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum but not that this sum was equal to
arithmetical propositions are therefore always synthetical of which we may become more clearly convinced by trying large numbers
for it will thus become quite evident that turn and twist our conceptions as we may it is impossible without having recourse to intuition to arrive at the sum total or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions
just as little is any principle of pure geometry analytical
a straight line between two points is the shortest is a synthetical proposition
for my conception of straight contains no notion of quantity but is merely qualitative
the conception of the shortest is therefore fore wholly an addition and by no analysis can it be extracted from our conception of a straight line
intuition must therefore here lend its aid by means of which and thus only our synthesis is possible
some few principles preposited by geometricians are indeed really analytical and depend on the principle of contradiction
they serve however like identical propositions as links in the chain of method not as principlesfor example a a the whole is equal to itself or ab a the whole is greater than its part
and yet even these principles themselves though they derive their validity from pure conceptions are only admitted in mathematics because they can be presented in intuition
what causes us here commonly to believe that the predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already contained in our conception and that the judgement is therefore analytical is merely the equivocal nature of the expression
we must join in thought a certain predicate to a given conception and this necessity cleaves already to the conception
but the question is not what we must join in thought to the given conception but what we really think therein though only obscurely and then it becomes manifest that the predicate pertains to these conceptions necessarily indeed yet not as thought in the conception itself but by virtue of an intuition which must be added to the conception
the science of natural philosophy physics contains in itself synthetical judgements priori as principles
i shall adduce two propositions
for instance the proposition in all changes of the material world the quantity of matter remains unchanged or that in all communication of motion action and reaction must always be equal
in both of these not only is the necessity and therefore their origin priori clear but also that they are synthetical propositions
for in the conception of matter i do not cogitate its permanency but merely its presence in space which it fills
i therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter in order to think on to it something priori which i did not think in it
the proposition is therefore not analytical but synthetical and nevertheless conceived priori and so it is with regard to the other propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy
as to metaphysics even if we look upon it merely as an attempted science yet from the nature of human reason an indispensable one we find that it must contain synthetical propositions priori
it is not merely the duty of metaphysics to dissect and thereby analytically to illustrate the conceptions which we form priori of things but we seek to widen the range of our priori knowledge
for this purpose we must avail ourselves of such principles as add something to the original conceptionsomething not identical with nor contained in it and by means of synthetical judgements priori leave far behind us the limits of experience for example in the proposition the world must have a beginning and such like
thus metaphysics according to the proper aim of the science consists merely of synthetical propositions priori
vi
the universal problem of pure reason
it is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigations under the formula of a single problem
for in this manner we not only facilitate our own labour inasmuch as we define it clearly to ourselves but also render it more easy for others to decide whether we have done justice to our undertaking
the proper problem of pure reason then is contained in the question how are synthetical judgements priori possible
that metaphysical science has hitherto remained in so vacillating a state of uncertainty and contradiction is only to be attributed to the fact that this great problem and perhaps even the difference between analytical and synthetical judgements did not sooner suggest itself to philosophers
upon the solution of this problem or upon sufficient proof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge priori depends the existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics
among philosophers david hume came the nearest of all to this problem yet it never acquired in his mind sufficient precision nor did he regard the question in its universality
on the contrary he stopped short at the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its cause principium causalitatis insisting that such proposition priori was impossible
according to his conclusions then all that we term metaphysical science is a mere delusion arising from the fancied insight of reason into that which is in truth borrowed from experience and to which habit has given the appearance of necessity
against this assertion destructive to all pure philosophy he would have been guarded had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality
for he would then have perceived that according to his own argument there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science which assuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions priorian absurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him
in the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehended the possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation and construction of all sciences which contain theoretical knowledge priori of objects that is to say the answer to the following questions
how is pure mathematical science possible
how is pure natural science possible
respecting these sciences as they do certainly exist it may with propriety be asked how they are possiblefor that they must be possible is shown by the fact of their really existing
but as to metaphysics the miserable progress it has hitherto made and the fact that of no one system yet brought forward far as regards its true aim can it be said that this science really exists leaves any one at liberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of its existence
as to the existence of pure natural science or physics perhaps many may still express doubts
but we have only to look at the different propositions which are commonly treated of at the commencement of proper empirical physical sciencethose for example relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter the vis inertiae the equality of action and reaction etc
to be soon convinced that they form a science of pure physics physica pura or rationalis which well deserves to be separately exposed as a special science in its whole extent whether that be great or confined
yet in a certain sense this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be looked upon as given in other words metaphysics must be considered as really existing if not as a science nevertheless as a natural disposition of the human mind metaphysica naturalis
for human reason without any instigations imputable to the mere vanity of great knowledge unceasingly progresses urged on by its own feeling of need towards such questions as cannot be answered by any empirical application of reason or principles derived therefrom and so there has ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics
it will always exist so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of its power of speculation
and now the question arises how is metaphysics as a natural disposition possible in other words how from the nature of universal human reason do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to itself and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well as it can
but as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions which reason is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself for example whether the world had a beginning or has existed from eternity it has always met with unavoidable contradictions we must not rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition of the mind to metaphysics that is with the existence of the faculty of pure reason whence indeed some sort of metaphysical system always arises but it must be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the question whether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats
we must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of its questions or on the ability or inability of reason to form any judgement respecting them and therefore either to extend with confidence the bounds of our pure reason or to set strictly defined and safe limits to its action
this last question which arises out of the above universal problem would properly run thus how is metaphysics possible as a science
thus the critique of reason leads at last naturally and necessarily to science and on the other hand the dogmatical use of reason without criticism leads to groundless assertions against which others equally specious can always be set thus ending unavoidably in scepticism
besides this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity because it has not to do with objects of reason the variety of which is inexhaustible but merely with reason herself and her problems problems which arise out of her own bosom and are not proposed to her by the nature of outward things but by her own nature
and when once reason has previously become able completely to understand her own power in regard to objects which she meets with in experience it will be easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her attempted application to objects beyond the confines of experience
we may and must therefore regard the attempts hitherto made to establish metaphysical science dogmatically as nonexistent
for what of analysis that is mere dissection of conceptions is contained in one or other is not the aim of but only a preparation for metaphysics proper which has for its object the extension by means of synthesis of our priori knowledge
and for this purpose mere analysis is of course useless because it only shows what is contained in these conceptions but not how we arrive priori at them and this it is her duty to show in order to be able afterwards to determine their valid use in regard to all objects of experience to all knowledge in general
but little selfdenial indeed is needed to give up these pretensions seeing the undeniable and in the dogmatic mode of procedure inevitable contradictions of reason with herself have long since ruined the reputation of every system of metaphysics that has appeared up to this time
it will require more firmness to remain undeterred by difficulty from within and opposition from without from endeavouring by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to human reasona science from which every branch it has borne may be cut away but whose roots remain indestructible
vii
idea and division of a particular science under the name of a critique of pure reason
from all that has been said there results the idea of a particular science which may be called the critique of pure reason
for reason is the faculty which furnishes us with the principles of knowledge priori
hence pure reason is the faculty which contains the principles of cognizing anything absolutely priori
an organon of pure reason would be a compendium of those principles according to which alone all pure cognitions priori can be obtained
the completely extended application of such an organon would afford us a system of pure reason
as this however is demanding a great deal and it is yet doubtful whether any extension of our knowledge be here possible or if so in what cases we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure reason its sources and limits as the propdeutic to a system of pure reason
such a science must not be called a doctrine but only a critique of pure reason and its use in regard to speculation would be only negative not to enlarge the bounds of but to purify our reason and to shield it against errorwhich alone is no little gain
i apply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is not so much occupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of these objects so far as this mode of cognition is possible priori
a system of such conceptions would be called transcendental philosophy
but this again is still beyond the bounds of our present essay
for as such a science must contain a complete exposition not only of our synthetical priori but of our analytical priori knowledge it is of too wide a range for our present purpose because we do not require to carry our analysis any farther than is necessary to understand in their full extent the principles of synthesis priori with which alone we have to do
this investigation which we cannot properly call a doctrine but only a transcendental critique because it aims not at the enlargement but at the correction and guidance of our knowledge and is to serve as a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of all knowledge priori is the sole object of our present essay
such a critique is consequently as far as possible a preparation for an organon and if this new organon should be found to fail at least for a canon of pure reason according to which the complete system of the philosophy of pure reason whether it extend or limit the bounds of that reason might one day be set forth both analytically and synthetically
for that this is possible nay that such a system is not of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its ever being completed is evident
for we have not here to do with the nature of outward objects which is infinite but solely with the mind which judges of the nature of objects and again with the mind only in respect of its cognition priori
and the object of our investigations as it is not to be sought without but altogether within ourselves cannot remain concealed and in all probability is limited enough to be completely surveyed and fairly estimated according to its worth or worthlessness
still less let the reader here expect a critique of books and systems of pure reason our present object is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself
only when we make this critique our foundation do we possess a pure touchstone for estimating the philosophical value of ancient and modern writings on this subject and without this criterion the incompetent historian or judge decides upon and corrects the groundless assertions of others with his own which have themselves just as little foundation
transcendental philosophy is the idea of a science for which the critique of pure reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically that is from principles with a full guarantee for the validity and stability of all the parts which enter into the building
it is the system of all the principles of pure reason
if this critique itself does not assume the title of transcendental philosophy it is only because to be a complete system it ought to contain a full analysis of all human knowledge priori
our critique must indeed lay before us a complete enumeration of all the radical conceptions which constitute the said pure knowledge
but from the complete analysis of these conceptions themselves as also from a complete investigation of those derived from them it abstains with reason partly because it would be deviating from the end in view to occupy itself with this analysis since this process is not attended with the difficulty and insecurity to be found in the synthesis to which our critique is entirely devoted and partly because it would be inconsistent with the unity of our plan to burden this essay with the vindication of the completeness of such an analysis and deduction with which after all we have at present nothing to do
this completeness of the analysis of these radical conceptions as well as of the deduction from the conceptions priori which may be given by the analysis we can however easily attain provided only that we are in possession of all these radical conceptions which are to serve as principles of the synthesis and that in respect of this main purpose nothing is wanting
to the critique of pure reason therefore belongs all that constitutes transcendental philosophy and it is the complete idea of transcendental philosophy but still not the science itself because it only proceeds so far with the analysis as is necessary to the power of judging completely of our synthetical knowledge priori
the principal thing we must attend to in the division of the parts of a science like this is that no conceptions must enter it which contain aught empirical in other words that the knowledge priori must be completely pure
hence although the highest principles and fundamental conceptions of morality are certainly cognitions priori yet they do not belong to transcendental philosophy because though they certainly do not lay the conceptions of pain pleasure desires inclinations etc
which are all of empirical origin at the foundation of its precepts yet still into the conception of dutyas an obstacle to be overcome or as an incitement which should not be made into a motivethese empirical conceptions must necessarily enter in the construction of a system of pure morality
transcendental philosophy is consequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason
for all that is practical so far as it contains motives relates to feelings and these belong to empirical sources of cognition
if we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a science in general it ought to comprehend first a doctrine of the elements and secondly a doctrine of the method of pure reason
each of these main divisions will have its subdivisions the separate reasons for which we cannot here particularize
only so much seems necessary by way of introduction of premonition that there are two sources of human knowledge which probably spring from a common but to us unknown root namely sense and understanding
by the former objects are given to us by the latter thought
so far as the faculty of sense may contain representations priori which form the conditions under which objects are given in so far it belongs to transcendental philosophy
the transcendental doctrine of sense must form the first part of our science of elements because the conditions under which alone the objects of human knowledge are given must precede those under which they are thought

introductory
in whatsoever mode or by whatsoever means our knowledge may relate to objects it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them is by means of an intuition
to this as the indispensable groundwork all thought points
but an intuition can take place only in so far as the object is given to us
this again is only possible to man at least on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner
the capacity for receiving representations receptivity through the mode in which we are affected by objects objects is called sensibility
by means of sensibility therefore objects are given to us and it alone furnishes us with intuitions by the understanding they are thought and from it arise conceptions
but an thought must directly or indirectly by means of certain signs relate ultimately to intuitions consequently with us to sensibility because in no other way can an object be given to us
the effect of an object upon the faculty of representation so far as we are affected by the said object is sensation
that sort of intuition which relates to an object by means of sensation is called an empirical intuition
the undetermined object of an empirical intuition is called phenomenon
that which in the phenomenon corresponds to the sensation i term its matter but that which effects that the content of the phenomenon can be arranged under certain relations i call its form
but that in which our sensations are merely arranged and by which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form cannot be itself sensation
it is then the matter of all phenomena that is given to us posteriori the form must lie ready priori for them in the mind and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation
i call all representations pure in the transcendental meaning of the word wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation
and accordingly we find existing in the mind priori the pure form of sensuous intuitions in general in which all the manifold content of the phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations
this pure form of sensibility i shall call pure intuition
thus if i take away from our representation of a body all that the understanding thinks as belonging to it as substance force divisibility etc
and also whatever belongs to sensation as impenetrability hardness colour etc
yet there is still something left us from this empirical intuition namely extension and shape
these belong to pure intuition which exists priori in the mind as a mere form of sensibility and without any real object of the senses or any sensation
the science of all the principles of sensibility priori i call transcendental sthetic
there must then be such a science forming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements in contradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure thought and which is called transcendental logic
the germans are the only people who at present use this word to indicate what others call the critique of taste
at the foundation of this term lies the disappointed hope which the eminent analyst baumgarten conceived of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason and so of elevating its rules into a science
but his endeavours were vain
for the said rules or criteria are in respect to their chief sources merely empirical consequently never can serve as determinate laws priori by which our judgement in matters of taste is to be directed
it is rather our judgement which forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles
on this account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating the critique of taste and to apply it solely to that doctrine which is true sciencethe science of the laws of sensibilityand thus come nearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their wellknown division of the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai noeta or to share it with speculative philosophy and employ it partly in a transcendental partly in a psychological signification
in the science of transcendental sthetic accordingly we shall first isolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty by separating from it all that is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding so that nothing be left but empirical intuition
in the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation so that nothing may remain but pure intuition and the mere form of phenomena which is all that the sensibility can afford priori
from this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition as principles of knowledge priori namely space and time
to the consideration of these we shall now proceed
section i
of space
metaphysical exposition of this conception
by means of the external sense a property of the mind we represent to ourselves objects as without us and these all in space
herein alone are their shape dimensions and relations to each other determined or determinable
the internal sense by means of which the mind contemplates itself or its internal state gives indeed no intuition of the soul as an object yet there is nevertheless a determinate form under which alone the contemplation of our internal state is possible so that all which relates to the inward determinations of the mind is represented in relations of time
of time we cannot have any external intuition any more than we can have an internal intuition of space
what then are time and space are they real existences or are they merely relations or determinations of things such however as would equally belong to these things in themselves though they should never become objects of intuition or are they such as belong only to the form of intuition and consequently to the subjective constitution of the mind without which these predicates of time and space could not be attached to any object in order to become informed on these points we shall first give an exposition of the conception of space
by exposition i mean the clear though not detailed representation of that which belongs to a conception and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains that which represents the conception as given priori
space is not a conception which has been derived from outward experiences
for in order that certain sensations may relate to something without me that is to something which occupies a different part of space from that in which i am in like manner in order that i may represent them not merely as without of and near to each other but also in separate places the representation of space must already exist as a foundation
consequently the representation of space cannot be borrowed from the relations of external phenomena through experience but on the contrary this external experience is itself only possible through the said antecedent representation
space then is a necessary representation priori which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions
we never can imagine or make a representation to ourselves of the nonexistence of space though we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it
it must therefore be considered as the condition of the possibility of phenomena and by no means as a determination dependent on them and is a representation priori which necessarily supplies the basis for external phenomena
space is no discursive or as we say general conception of the relations of things but a pure intuition
for in the first place we can only represent to ourselves one space and when we talk of divers spaces we mean only parts of one and the same space
moreover these parts cannot antecede this one allembracing space as the component parts from which the aggregate can be made up but can be cogitated only as existing in it
space is essentially one and multiplicity in it consequently the general notion of spaces of this or that space depends solely upon limitations
hence it follows that an priori intuition which is not empirical lies at the root of all our conceptions of space
thus moreover the principles of geometryfor example that in a triangle two sides together are greater than the third are never deduced from general conceptions of line and triangle but from intuition and this priori with apodeictic certainty
space is represented as an infinite given quantity
now every conception must indeed be considered as a representation which is contained in an infinite multitude of different possible representations which therefore comprises these under itself but no conception as such can be so conceived as if it contained within itself an infinite multitude of representations
nevertheless space is so conceived of for all parts of space are equally capable of being produced to infinity
consequently the original representation of space is an intuition priori and not a conception
transcendental exposition of the conception of space
by a transcendental exposition i mean the explanation of a conception as a principle whence can be discerned the possibility of other synthetical priori cognitions
for this purpose it is requisite firstly that such cognitions do really flow from the given conception and secondly that the said cognitions are only possible under the presupposition of a given mode of explaining this conception
geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically and yet priori
what then must be our representation of space in order that such a cognition of it may be possible it must be originally intuition for from a mere conception no propositions can be deduced which go out beyond the conception and yet this happens in geometry
introd
v
but this intuition must be found in the mind priori that is before any perception of objects consequently must be pure not empirical intuition
for geometrical principles are always apodeictic that is united with the consciousness of their necessity as space has only three dimensions
but propositions of this kind cannot be empirical judgements nor conclusions from them
introd
ii
now how can an external intuition anterior to objects themselves and in which our conception of objects can be determined priori exist in the human mind obviously not otherwise than in so far as it has its seat in the subject only as the formal capacity of the subjects being affected by objects and thereby of obtaining immediate representation that is intuition consequently only as the form of the external sense in general
thus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility of geometry as a synthetical science priori becomes comprehensible
every mode of explanation which does not show us this possibility although in appearance it may be similar to ours can with the utmost certainty be distinguished from it by these marks
conclusions from the foregoing conceptions
a space does not represent any property of objects as things in themselves nor does it represent them in their relations to each other in other words space does not represent to us any determination of objects such as attaches to the objects themselves and would remain even though all subjective conditions of the intuition were abstracted
for neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects can be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they belong and therefore not priori
b space is nothing else than the form of all phenomena of the external sense that is the subjective condition of the sensibility under which alone external intuition is possible
now because the receptivity or capacity of the subject to be affected by objects necessarily antecedes all intuitions of these objects it is easily understood how the form of all phenomena can be given in the mind previous to all actual perceptions therefore priori and how it as a pure intuition in which all objects must be determined can contain principles of the relations of these objects prior to all experience
it is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of space extended objects etc
if we depart from the subjective condition under which alone we can obtain external intuition or in other words by means of which we are affected by objects the representation of space has no meaning whatsoever
this predicate is only applicable to things in so far as they appear to us that is are objects of sensibility
the constant form of this receptivity which we call sensibility is a necessary condition of all relations in which objects can be intuited as existing without us and when abstraction of these objects is made is a pure intuition to which we give the name of space
it is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things but only of the possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena
and so we may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us externally but not all things considered as things in themselves be they intuited or not or by whatsoever subject one will
as to the intuitions of other thinking beings we cannot judge whether they are or are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition and which for us are universally valid
if we join the limitation of a judgement to the conception of the subject then the judgement will possess unconditioned validity
for example the proposition all objects are beside each other in space is valid only under the limitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous intuition
but if i join the condition to the conception and say all things as external phenomena are beside each other in space then the rule is valid universally and without any limitation
our expositions consequently teach the reality i
e
the objective validity of space in regard of all which can be presented to us externally as object and at the same time also the ideality of space in regard to objects when they are considered by means of reason as things in themselves that is without reference to the constitution of our sensibility
we maintain therefore the empirical reality of space in regard to all possible external experience although we must admit its transcendental ideality in other words that it is nothing so soon as we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all experience depends and look upon space as something that belongs to things in themselves
but with the exception of space there is no representation subjective and referring to something external to us which could be called objective priori
for there are no other subjective representations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions priori as we can from the intuition of space
see
therefore to speak accurately no ideality whatever belongs to these although they agree in this respect with the representation of space that they belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous perception such a mode for example as that of sight of hearing and of feeling by means of the sensations of colour sound and heat but which because they are only sensations and not intuitions do not of themselves give us the cognition of any object least of all an priori cognition
my purpose in the above remark is merely this to guard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space by examples quite insufficient for example by colour taste etc
for these must be contemplated not as properties of things but only as changes in the subject changes which may be different in different men
for in such a case that which is originally a mere phenomenon a rose for example is taken by the empirical understanding for a thing in itself though to every different eye in respect of its colour it may appear different
on the contrary the transcendental conception of phenomena in space is a critical admonition that in general nothing which is intuited in space is a thing in itself and that space is not a form which belongs as a property to things but that objects are quite unknown to us in themselves and what we call outward objects are nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility whose form is space but whose real correlate the thing in itself is not known by means of these representations nor ever can be but respecting which in experience no inquiry is ever made
section ii
of time
metaphysical exposition of this conception
time is not an empirical conception
for neither coexistence nor succession would be perceived by us if the representation of time did not exist as a foundation priori
without this presupposition we could not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one and the same time or at different times that is contemporaneously or in succession
time is a necessary representation lying at the foundation of all our intuitions
with regard to phenomena in general we cannot think away time from them and represent them to ourselves as out of and unconnected with time but we can quite well represent to ourselves time void of phenomena
time is therefore given priori
in it alone is all reality of phenomena possible
these may all be annihilated in thought but time itself as the universal condition of their possibility cannot be so annulled
on this necessity priori is also founded the possibility of apodeictic principles of the relations of time or axioms of time in general such as time has only one dimension different times are not coexistent but successive as different spaces are not successive but coexistent
these principles cannot be derived from experience for it would give neither strict universality nor apodeictic certainty
we should only be able to say so common experience teaches us but not it must be so
they are valid as rules through which in general experience is possible and they instruct us respecting experience and not by means of it
time is not a discursive or as it is called general conception but a pure form of the sensuous intuition
different times are merely parts of one and the same time
but the representation which can only be given by a single object is an intuition
besides the proposition that different times cannot be coexistent could not be derived from a general conception
for this proposition is synthetical and therefore cannot spring out of conceptions alone
it is therefore contained immediately in the intuition and representation of time
the infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every determined quantity of time is possible only through limitations of one time lying at the foundation
consequently the original representation time must be given as unlimited
but as the determinate representation of the parts of time and of every quantity of an object can only be obtained by limitation the complete representation of time must not be furnished by means of conceptions for these contain only partial representations
conceptions on the contrary must have immediate intuition for their basis
transcendental exposition of the conception of time
i may here refer to what is said above where for or sake of brevity i have placed under the head of metaphysical exposition that which is properly transcendental
here i shall add that the conception of change and with it the conception of motion as change of place is possible only through and in the representation of time that if this representation were not an intuition internal priori no conception of whatever kind could render comprehensible the possibility of change in other words of a conjunction of contradictorily opposed predicates in one and the same object for example the presence of a thing in a place and the nonpresence of the same thing in the same place
it is only in time that it is possible to meet with two contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing that is after each other
thus our conception of time explains the possibility of so much synthetical knowledge priori as is exhibited in the general doctrine of motion which is not a little fruitful
conclusions from the above conceptions
a time is not something which subsists of itself or which inheres in things as an objective determination and therefore remains when abstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things
for in the former case it would be something real yet without presenting to any power of perception any real object
in the latter case as an order or determination inherent in things themselves it could not be antecedent to things as their condition nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions priori
but all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place
for in that case this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects and consequently priori
b time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense that is of the intuitions of self and of our internal state
for time cannot be any determination of outward phenomena
it has to do neither with shape nor position on the contrary it determines the relation of representations in our internal state
and precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no shape or form we endeavour to supply this want by analogies and represent the course of time by a line progressing to infinity the content of which constitutes a series which is only of one dimension and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time with this single exception that the parts of the line are coexistent whilst those of time are successive
from this it is clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition because all its relations can be expressed in an external intuition
c time is the formal condition priori of all phenomena whatsoever
space as the pure form of external intuition is limited as a condition priori to external phenomena alone
on the other hand because all representations whether they have or have not external things for their objects still in themselves as determinations of the mind belong to our internal state and because this internal state is subject to the formal condition of the internal intuition that is to timetime is a condition priori of all phenomena whatsoeverthe immediate condition of all internal and thereby the mediate condition of all external phenomena
if i can say priori all outward phenomena are in space and determined priori according to the relations of space i can also from the principle of the internal sense affirm universally all phenomena in general that is all objects of the senses are in time and stand necessarily in relations of time
if we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuitions possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and presented to us by our faculty of representation and consequently take objects as they are in themselves then time is nothing
it is only of objective validity in regard to phenomena because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses
it no longer objective we make abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition in other words of that mode of representation which is peculiar to us and speak of things in general
time is therefore merely a subjective condition of our human intuition which is always sensuous that is so far as we are affected by objects and in itself independently of the mind or subject is nothing
nevertheless in respect of all phenomena consequently of all things which come within the sphere of our experience it is necessarily objective
we cannot say all things are in time because in this conception of things in general we abstract and make no mention of any sort of intuition of things
but this is the proper condition under which time belongs to our representation of objects
if we add the condition to the conception and say all things as phenomena that is objects of sensuous intuition are in time then the proposition has its sound objective validity and universality priori
what we have now set forth teaches therefore the empirical reality of time that is its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be presented to our senses
and as our intuition is always sensuous no object ever can be presented to us in experience which does not come under the conditions of time
on the other hand we deny to time all claim to absolute reality that is we deny that it without having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property
such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through the medium of the senses
herein consists therefore the transcendental ideality of time according to which if we abstract the subjective conditions of sensuous intuition it is nothing and cannot be reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in themselves independently of its relation to our intuition
this ideality like that of space is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with sensations for this reasonthat in such arguments or illustrations we make the presupposition that the phenomenon in which such and such predicates inhere has objective reality while in this case we can only find such an objective reality as is itself empirical that is regards the object as a mere phenomenon
in reference to this subject see the remark in section i
elucidation
against this theory which grants empirical reality to time but denies to it absolute and transcendental reality i have heard from intelligent men an objection so unanimously urged that i conclude that it must naturally present itself to every reader to whom these considerations are novel
it runs thus changes are real this the continual change in our own representations demonstrates even though the existence of all external phenomena together with their changes is denied
now changes are only possible in time and therefore time must be something real
but there is no difficulty in answering this
i grant the whole argument
time no doubt is something real that is it is the real form of our internal intuition
it therefore has subjective reality in reference to our internal experience that is i have really the representation of time and of my determinations therein
time therefore is not to be regarded as an object but as the mode of representation of myself as an object
but if i could intuite myself or be intuited by another being without this condition of sensibility then those very determinations which we now represent to ourselves as changes would present to us a knowledge in which the representation of time and consequently of change would not appear
the empirical reality of time therefore remains as the condition of all our experience
but absolute reality according to what has been said above cannot be granted it
time is nothing but the form of our internal intuition
if we take away from it the special condition of our sensibility the conception of time also vanishes and it inheres not in the objects themselves but solely in the subject or mind which intuites them
i can indeed say my representations follow one another or are successive but this means only that we are conscious of them as in a succession that is according to the form of the internal sense
time therefore is not a thing in itself nor is it any objective determination pertaining to or inherent in things
but the reason why this objection is so unanimously brought against our doctrine of time and that too by disputants who cannot start any intelligible arguments against the doctrine of the ideality of space is thisthey have no hope of demonstrating apodeictically the absolute reality of space because the doctrine of idealism is against them according to which the reality of external objects is not capable of any strict proof
on the other hand the reality of the object of our internal sense that is myself and my internal state is clear immediately through consciousness
the formerexternal objects in spacemight be a mere delusion but the latterthe object of my internal perceptionis undeniably real
they do not however reflect that both without question of their reality as representations belong only to the genus phenomenon which has always two aspects the one the object considered as a thing in itself without regard to the mode of intuiting it and the nature of which remains for this very reason problematical the other the form of our intuition of the object which must be sought not in the object as a thing in itself but in the subject to which it appearswhich form of intuition nevertheless belongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object
time and space are therefore two sources of knowledge from which priori various synthetical cognitions can be drawn
of this we find a striking example in the cognitions of space and its relations which form the foundation of pure mathematics
they are the two pure forms of all intuitions and thereby make synthetical propositions priori possible
but these sources of knowledge being merely conditions of our sensibility do therefore and as such strictly determine their own range and purpose in that they do not and cannot present objects as things in themselves but are applicable to them solely in so far as they are considered as sensuous phenomena
the sphere of phenomena is the only sphere of their validity and if we venture out of this no further objective use can be made of them
for the rest this formal reality of time and space leaves the validity of our empirical knowledge unshaken for our certainty in that respect is equally firm whether these forms necessarily inhere in the things themselves or only in our intuitions of them
on the other hand those who maintain the absolute reality of time and space whether as essentially subsisting or only inhering as modifications in things must find themselves at utter variance with the principles of experience itself
for if they decide for the first view and make space and time into substances this being the side taken by mathematical natural philosophers they must admit two selfsubsisting nonentities infinite and eternal which exist yet without there being anything real for the purpose of containing in themselves everything that is real
if they adopt the second view of inherence which is preferred by some metaphysical natural philosophers and regard space and time as relations contiguity in space or succession in time abstracted from experience though represented confusedly in this state of separation they find themselves in that case necessitated to deny the validity of mathematical doctrines priori in reference to real things for example in spaceat all events their apodeictic certainty
for such certainty cannot be found in an posteriori proposition and the conceptions priori of space and time are according to this opinion mere creations of the imagination having their source really in experience inasmuch as out of relations abstracted from experience imagination has made up something which contains indeed general statements of these relations yet of which no application can be made without the restrictions attached thereto by nature
the former of these parties gains this advantage that they keep the sphere of phenomena free for mathematical science
on the other hand these very conditions space and time embarrass them greatly when the understanding endeavours to pass the limits of that sphere
the latter has indeed this advantage that the representations of space and time do not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects not as phenomena but merely in their relation to the understanding
devoid however of a true and objectively valid priori intuition they can neither furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematical cognitions priori nor bring the propositions of experience into necessary accordance with those of mathematics
in our theory of the true nature of these two original forms of the sensibility both difficulties are surmounted
in conclusion that transcendental sthetic cannot contain any more than these two elementsspace and time is sufficiently obvious from the fact that all other conceptions appertaining to sensibility even that of motion which unites in itself both elements presuppose something empirical
motion for example presupposes the perception of something movable
but space considered in itself contains nothing movable consequently motion must be something which is found in space only through experiencein other words an empirical datum
in like manner transcendental sthetic cannot number the conception of change among its data priori for time itself does not change but only something which is in time
to acquire the conception of change therefore the perception of some existing object and of the succession of its determinations in one word experience is necessary
general remarks on transcendental sthetic
i
in order to prevent any misunderstanding it will be requisite in the first place to recapitulate as clearly as possible what our opinion is with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous cognition in general
we have intended then to say that all our intuition is nothing but the representation of phenomena that the things which we intuite are not in themselves the same as our representations of them in intuition nor are their relations in themselves so constituted as they appear to us and that if we take away the subject or even only the subjective constitution of our senses in general then not only the nature and relations of objects in space and time but even space and time themselves disappear and that these as phenomena cannot exist in themselves but only in us
what may be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves and without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite unknown to us
we know nothing more than our mode of perceiving them which is peculiar to us and which though not of necessity pertaining to every animated being is so to the whole human race
with this alone we have to do
space and time are the pure forms thereof sensation the matter
the former alone can we cognize priori that is antecedent to all actual perception and for this reason such cognition is called pure intuition
the latter is that in our cognition which is called cognition posteriori that is empirical intuition
the former appertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility of whatsoever kind our sensations may be the latter may be of very diversified character
supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition even to the very highest degree of clearness we should not thereby advance one step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as things in themselves
for we could only at best arrive at a complete cognition of our own mode of intuition that is of our sensibility and this always under the conditions originally attaching to the subject namely the conditions of space and time while the question what are objects considered as things in themselves remains unanswerable even after the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world
to say then that all our sensibility is nothing but the confused representation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to them as things in themselves and this under an accumulation of characteristic marks and partial representations which we cannot distinguish in consciousness is a falsification of the conception of sensibility and phenomenization which renders our whole doctrine thereof empty and useless
the difference between a confused and a clear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do with content
no doubt the conception of right as employed by a sound understanding contains all that the most subtle investigation could unfold from it although in the ordinary practical use of the word we are not conscious of the manifold representations comprised in the conception
but we cannot for this reason assert that the ordinary conception is a sensuous one containing a mere phenomenon for right cannot appear as a phenomenon but the conception of it lies in the understanding and represents a property the moral property of actions which belongs to them in themselves
on the other hand the representation in intuition of a body contains nothing which could belong to an object considered as a thing in itself but merely the phenomenon or appearance of something and the mode in which we are affected by that appearance and this receptivity of our faculty of cognition is called sensibility and remains toto caelo different from the cognition of an object in itself even though we should examine the content of the phenomenon to the very bottom
it must be admitted that the leibnitzwolfian philosophy has assigned an entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into the nature and origin of our cognitions inasmuch as it regards the distinction between the sensuous and the intellectual as merely logical whereas it is plainly transcendental and concerns not merely the clearness or obscurity but the content and origin of both
for the faculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinct and confused cognition of objects as things in themselves but in fact gives us no knowledge of these at all
on the contrary so soon as we abstract in thought our own subjective nature the object represented with the properties ascribed to it by sensuous intuition entirely disappears because it was only this subjective nature that determined the form of the object as a phenomenon
in phenomena we commonly indeed distinguish that which essentially belongs to the intuition of them and is valid for the sensuous faculty of every human being from that which belongs to the same intuition accidentally as valid not for the sensuous faculty in general but for a particular state or organization of this or that sense
accordingly we are accustomed to say that the former is a cognition which represents the object itself whilst the latter presents only a particular appearance or phenomenon thereof
this distinction however is only empirical
if we stop here as is usual and do not regard the empirical intuition as itself a mere phenomenon as we ought to do in which nothing that can appertain to a thing in itself is to be found our transcendental distinction is lost and we believe that we cognize objects as things in themselves although in the whole range of the sensuous world investigate the nature of its objects as profoundly as we may we have to do with nothing but phenomena
thus we call the rainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower and the rain the reality or thing in itself and this is right enough if we understand the latter conception in a merely physical sense that is as that which in universal experience and under whatever conditions of sensuous perception is known in intuition to be so and so determined and not otherwise
but if we consider this empirical datum generally and inquire without reference to its accordance with all our senses whether there can be discovered in it aught which represents an object as a thing in itself the raindrops of course are not such for they are as phenomena empirical objects the question of the relation of the representation to the object is transcendental and not only are the raindrops mere phenomena but even their circular form nay the space itself through which they fall is nothing in itself but both are mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous intuition whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly unknown
the second important concern of our sthetic is that it does not obtain favour merely as a plausible hypothesis but possess as undoubted a character of certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is to serve for an organon
in order fully to convince the reader of this certainty we shall select a case which will serve to make its validity apparent and also to illustrate what has been said in
suppose then that space and time are in themselves objective and conditions of thepossibility of objects as things in themselves
in the first place it is evident that both present us with very many apodeictic and synthetic propositions priori but especially spaceand for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation at present
as the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically priori and with apodeictic certainty i inquire whence do you obtain propositions of this kind and on what basis does the understanding rest in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universally valid truths
there is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions as such and these are given either priori or posteriori
the latter namely empirical conceptions together with the empirical intuition on which they are founded cannot afford any synthetical proposition except such as is itself also empirical that is a proposition of experience
but an empirical proposition cannot possess the qualities of necessity and absolute universality which nevertheless are the characteristics of all geometrical propositions
as to the first and only means to arrive at such cognitions namely through mere conceptions or intuitions priori it is quite clear that from mere conceptions no synthetical cognitions but only analytical ones can be obtained
take for example the proposition two straight lines cannot enclose a space and with these alone no figure is possible and try to deduce it from the conception of a straight line and the number two or take the proposition it is possible to construct a figure with three straight lines and endeavour in like manner to deduce it from the mere conception of a straight line and the number three
all your endeavours are in vain and you find yourself forced to have recourse to intuition as in fact geometry always does
you therefore give yourself an object in intuition
but of what kind is this intuition is it a pure priori or is it an empirical intuition if the latter then neither an universally valid much less an apodeictic proposition can arise from it for experience never can give us any such proposition
you must therefore give yourself an object priori in intuition and upon that ground your synthetical proposition
now if there did not exist within you a faculty of intuition priori if this subjective condition were not in respect to its form also the universal condition priori under which alone the object of this external intuition is itself possible if the object that is the triangle were something in itself without relation to you the subject how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in your subjective conditions in order to construct a triangle must also necessarily belong to the triangle in itself for to your conceptions of three lines you could not add anything new that is the figure which therefore must necessarily be found in the object because the object is given before your cognition and not by means of it
if therefore space and time also were not a mere form of your intuition which contains conditions priori under which alone things can become external objects for you and without which subjective conditions the objects are in themselves nothing you could not construct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding external objects
it is therefore not merely possible or probable but indubitably certain that space and time as the necessary conditions of all our external and internal experience are merely subjective conditions of all our intuitions in relation to which all objects are therefore mere phenomena and not things in themselves presented to us in this particular manner
and for this reason in respect to the form of phenomena much may be said priori whilst of the thing in itself which may lie at the foundation of these phenomena it is impossible to say anything
ii
in confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external as well as internal sense consequently of all objects of sense as mere phenomena we may especially remark that all in our cognition that belongs to intuition contains nothing more than mere relations
the feelings of pain and pleasure and the will which are not cognitions are excepted
the relations to wit of place in an intuition extension change of place motion and laws according to which this change is determined moving forces
that however which is present in this or that place or any operation going on or result taking place in the things themselves with the exception of change of place is not given to us by intuition
now by means of mere relations a thing cannot be known in itself and it may therefore be fairly concluded that as through the external sense nothing but mere representations of relations are given us the said external sense in its representation can contain only the relation of the object to the subject but not the essential nature of the object as a thing in itself
the same is the case with the internal intuition not only because in the internal intuition the representation of the external senses constitutes the material with which the mind is occupied but because time in which we place and which itself antecedes the consciousness of these representations in experience and which as the formal condition of the mode according to which objects are placed in the mind lies at the foundation of them contains relations of the successive the coexistent and of that which always must be coexistent with succession the permanent
now that which as representation can antecede every exercise of thought of an object is intuition and when it contains nothing but relations it is the form of the intuition which as it presents us with no representation except in so far as something is placed in the mind can be nothing else than the mode in which the mind is affected by its own activity to witits presenting to itself representations consequently the mode in which the mind is affected by itself that is it can be nothing but an internal sense in respect to its form
everything that is represented through the medium of sense is so far phenomenal consequently we must either refuse altogether to admit an internal sense or the subject which is the object of that sense could only be represented by it as phenomenon and not as it would judge of itself if its intuition were pure spontaneous activity that is were intellectual
the difficulty here lies wholly in the question how can the subject have an internal intuition of itself but this difficulty is common to every theory
the consciousness of self apperception is the simple representation of the ego and if by means of that representation alone all the manifold representations in the subject were spontaneously given then our internal intuition would be intellectual
this consciousness in man requires an internal perception of the manifold representations which are previously given in the subject and the manner in which these representations are given in the mind without spontaneity must on account of this difference the want of spontaneity be called sensibility
if the faculty of selfconsciousness is to apprehend what lies in the mind it must all act that and can in this way alone produce an intuition of self
but the form of this intuition which lies in the original constitution of the mind determines in the representation of time the manner in which the manifold representations are to combine themselves in the mind since the subject intuites itself not as it would represent itself immediately and spontaneously but according to the manner in which the mind is internally affected consequently as it appears and not as it is
iii
when we say that the intuition of external objects and also the selfintuition of the subject represent both objects and subject in space and time as they affect our senses that is as they appearthis is by no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mere illusory appearances
for when we speak of things as phenomena the objects nay even the properties which we ascribe to them are looked upon as really given only that in so far as this or that property depends upon the mode of intuition of the subject in the relation of the given object to the subject the object as phenomenon is to be distinguished from the object as a thing in itself
thus i do not say that bodies seem or appear to be external to me or that my soul seems merely to be given in my selfconsciousness although i maintain that the properties of space and time in conformity to which i set both as the condition of their existence abide in my mode of intuition and not in the objects in themselves
it would be my own fault if out of that which i should reckon as phenomenon i made mere illusory appearance
but this will not happen because of our principle of the ideality of all sensuous intuitions
on the contrary if we ascribe objective reality to these forms of representation it becomes impossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance
for if we regard space and time as properties which must be found in objects as things in themselves as sine quibus non of the possibility of their existence and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find ourselves involved inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence of two infinite things which are nevertheless not substances nor anything really inhering in substances nay to admit that they are the necessary conditions of the existence of all things and moreover that they must continue to exist although all existing things were annihilatedwe cannot blame the good berkeley for degrading bodies to mere illusory appearances
nay even our own existence which would in this case depend upon the selfexistent reality of such a mere nonentity as time would necessarily be changed with it into mere appearancean absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of
the predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object itself in relation to our sensuous faculty for example the red colour or the perfume to the rose
but illusory appearance never can be attributed as a predicate to an object for this very reason that it attributes to this object in itself that which belongs to it only in relation to our sensuous faculty or to the subject in general e
g
the two handles which were formerly ascribed to saturn
that which is never to be found in the object itself but always in the relation of the object to the subject and which moreover is inseparable from our representation of the object we denominate phenomenon
thus the predicates of space and time are rightly attributed to objects of the senses as such and in this there is no illusion
on the contrary if i ascribe redness of the rose as a thing in itself or to saturn his handles or extension to all external objects considered as things in themselves without regarding the determinate relation of these objects to the subject and without limiting my judgement to that relationthen and then only arises illusion
iv
in natural theology where we think of an objectgodwhich never can be an object of intuition to us and even to himself can never be an object of sensuous intuition we carefully avoid attributing to his intuition the conditions of space and timeand intuition all his cognition must be and not thought which always includes limitation
but with what right can we do this if we make them forms of objects as things in themselves and such moreover as would continue to exist as priori conditions of the existence of things even though the things themselves were annihilated for as conditions of all existence in general space and time must be conditions of the existence of the supreme being also
but if we do not thus make them objective forms of all things there is no other way left than to make them subjective forms of our mode of intuitionexternal and internal which is called sensuous because it is not primitive that is is not such as gives in itself the existence of the object of the intuition a mode of intuition which so far as we can judge can belong only to the creator but is dependent on the existence of the object is possible therefore only on condition that the representative faculty of the subject is affected by the object
it is moreover not necessary that we should limit the mode of intuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man
it may well be that all finite thinking beings must necessarily in this respect agree with man though as to this we cannot decide but sensibility does not on account of this universality cease to be sensibility for this very reason that it is a deduced intuitus derivativus and not an original intuitus originarius consequently not an intellectual intuition and this intuition as such for reasons above mentioned seems to belong solely to the supreme being but never to a being dependent quoad its existence as well as its intuition which its existence determines and limits relatively to given objects
this latter remark however must be taken only as an illustration and not as any proof of the truth of our sthetical theory
conclusion of the transcendental sthetic
we have now completely before us one part of the solution of the grand general problem of transcendental philosophy namely the question how are synthetical propositions priori possible that is to say we have shown that we are in possession of pure priori intuitions namely space and time in which we find when in a judgement priori we pass out beyond the given conception something which is not discoverable in that conception but is certainly found priori in the intuition which corresponds to the conception and can be united synthetically with it
but the judgements which these pure intuitions enable us to make never reach farther than to objects of the senses and are valid only for objects of possible experience
second parttranscendental logic
introduction
idea of a transcendental logic
i
of logic in general
our knowledge springs from two main sources in the mind first of which is the faculty or power of receiving representations receptivity for impressions the second is the power of cognizing by means of these representations spontaneity in the production of conceptions
through the first an object is given to us through the second it is in relation to the representation which is a mere determination of the mind thought
intuition and conceptions constitute therefore the elements of all our knowledge so that neither conceptions without an intuition in some way corresponding to them nor intuition without conceptions can afford us a cognition
both are either pure or empirical
they are empirical when sensation which presupposes the actual presence of the object is contained in them and pure when no sensation is mixed with the representation
sensations we may call the matter of sensuous cognition
pure intuition consequently contains merely the form under which something is intuited and pure conception only the form of the thought of an object
only pure intuitions and pure conceptions are possible priori the empirical only posteriori
we apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for impressions in so far as it is in some way affected and on the other hand we call the faculty of spontaneously producing representations or the spontaneity of cognition understanding
our nature is so constituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous that is it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects
on the other hand the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous intuition is the understanding
neither of these faculties has a preference over the other
without the sensuous faculty no object would be given to us and without the understanding no object would be thought
thoughts without content are void intuitions without conceptions blind
hence it is as necessary for the mind to make its conceptions sensuous that is to join to them the object in intuition as to make its intuitions intelligible that is to bring them under conceptions
neither of these faculties can exchange its proper function
understanding cannot intuite and the sensuous faculty cannot think
in no other way than from the united operation of both can knowledge arise
but no one ought on this account to overlook the difference of the elements contributed by each we have rather great reason carefully to separate and distinguish them
we therefore distinguish the science of the laws of sensibility that is sthetic from the science of the laws of the understanding that is logic
now logic in its turn may be considered as twofoldnamely as logic of the general or of the particular use of the understanding
the first contains the absolutely necessary laws of thought without which no use whatsoever of the understanding is possible and gives laws therefore to the understanding without regard to the difference of objects on which it may be employed
the logic of the particular use of the understanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particular class of objects
the former may be called elemental logicthe latter the organon of this or that particular science
the latter is for the most part employed in the schools as a propdeutic to the sciences although indeed according to the course of human reason it is the last thing we arrive at when the science has been already matured and needs only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion for our knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must be tolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the laws by which a science of these objects can be established
general logic is again either pure or applied
in the former we abstract all the empirical conditions under which the understanding is exercised for example the influence of the senses the play of the fantasy or imagination the laws of the memory the force of habit of inclination etc
consequently also the sources of prejudicein a word we abstract all causes from which particular cognitions arise because these causes regard the understanding under certain circumstances of its application and to the knowledge of them experience is required
pure general logic has to do therefore merely with pure priori principles and is a canon of understanding and reason but only in respect of the formal part of their use be the content what it may empirical or transcendental
general logic is called applied when it is directed to the laws of the use of the understanding under the subjective empirical conditions which psychology teaches us
it has therefore empirical principles although at the same time it is in so far general that it applies to the exercise of the understanding without regard to the difference of objects
on this account moreover it is neither a canon of the understanding in general nor an organon of a particular science but merely a cathartic of the human understanding
in general logic therefore that part which constitutes pure logic must be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied though still general logic
the former alone is properly science although short and dry as the methodical exposition of an elemental doctrine of the understanding ought to be
in this therefore logicians must always bear in mind two rules
as general logic it makes abstraction of all content of the cognition of the understanding and of the difference of objects and has to do with nothing but the mere form of thought
as pure logic it has no empirical principles and consequently draws nothing contrary to the common persuasion from psychology which therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding
it is a demonstrated doctrine and everything in it must be certain completely priori
what i called applied logic contrary to the common acceptation of this term according to which it should contain certain exercises for the scholar for which pure logic gives the rules is a representation of the understanding and of the rules of its necessary employment in concreto that is to say under the accidental conditions of the subject which may either hinder or promote this employment and which are all given only empirically
thus applied logic treats of attention its impediments and consequences of the origin of error of the state of doubt hesitation conviction etc
and to it is related pure general logic in the same way that pure morality which contains only the necessary moral laws of a free will is related to practical ethics which considers these laws under all the impediments of feelings inclinations and passions to which men are more or less subjected and which never can furnish us with a true and demonstrated science because it as well as applied logic requires empirical and psychological principles
ii
of transcendental logic
general logic as we have seen makes abstraction of all content of cognition that is of all relation of cognition to its object and regards only the logical form in the relation of cognitions to each other that is the form of thought in general
but as we have both pure and empirical intuitions as transcendental sthetic proves in like manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empirical thought of objects
in this case there would exist a kind of logic in which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition for or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure thought of an object would of course exclude all those cognitions which were of empirical content
this kind of logic would also examine the origin of our cognitions of objects so far as that origin cannot be ascribed to the objects themselves while on the contrary general logic has nothing to do with the origin of our cognitions but contemplates our representations be they given primitively priori in ourselves or be they only of empirical origin solely according to the laws which the understanding observes in employing them in the process of thought in relation to each other
consequently general logic treats of the form of the understanding only which can be applied to representations from whatever source they may have arisen
and here i shall make a remark which the reader must bear well in mind in the course of the following considerations to wit that not every cognition priori but only those through which we cognize that and how certain representations intuitions or conceptions are applied or are possible only priori that is to say the priori possibility of cognition and the priori use of it are transcendental
therefore neither is space nor any priori geometrical determination of space a transcendental representation but only the knowledge that such a representation is not of empirical origin and the possibility of its relating to objects of experience although itself priori can be called transcendental
so also the application of space to objects in general would be transcendental but if it be limited to objects of sense it is empirical
thus the distinction of the transcendental and empirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions and does not concern the relation of these to their object
accordingly in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptions which relate priori to objects not as pure or sensuous intuitions but merely as acts of pure thought which are therefore conceptions but neither of empirical nor sthetical originin this expectation i say we form to ourselves by anticipation the idea of a science of pure understanding and rational cognition by means of which we may cogitate objects entirely priori
a science of this kind which should determine the origin the extent and the objective validity of such cognitions must be called transcendental logic because it has not like general logic to do with the laws of understanding and reason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions without distinction but concerns itself with these only in an priori relation to objects
iii
of the division of general logic into analytic and dialectic
the old question with which people sought to push logicians into a corner so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms or confess their ignorance and consequently the vanity of their whole art is this what is truth the definition of the word truth to wit the accordance of the cognition with its object is presupposed in the question but we desire to be told in the answer to it what is the universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition
to know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong evidence of sagacity and intelligence
for if a question be in itself absurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer it is attended with the dangernot to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes itof seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers and we are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one as the ancients said milking the hegoat and the other holding a sieve
if truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object this object must be ipso facto distinguished from all others for a cognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which it relates although it contains something which may be affirmed of other objects
now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is valid for all cognitions without distinction of their objects
but it is evident that since in the case of such a criterion we make abstraction of all the content of a cognition that is of all relation to its object and truth relates precisely to this content it must be utterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of cognition and that accordingly a sufficient and at the same time universal test of truth cannot possibly be found
as we have already termed the content of a cognition its matter we shall say of the truth of our cognitions in respect of their matter no universal test can be demanded because such a demand is selfcontradictory
on the other hand with regard to our cognition in respect of its mere form excluding all content it is equally manifest that logic in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of the understanding must in these very laws present us with criteria of truth
whatever contradicts these rules is false because thereby the understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought that is to contradict itself
these criteria however apply solely to the form of truth that is of thought in general and in so far they are perfectly accurate yet not sufficient
for although a cognition may be perfectly accurate as to logical form that is not selfcontradictory it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may not stand in agreement with its object
consequently the merely logical criterion of truth namely the accordance of a cognition with the universal and formal laws of understanding and reason is nothing more than the conditio sine qua non or negative condition of all truth
farther than this logic cannot go and the error which depends not on the form but on the content of the cognition it has no test to discover
general logic then resolves the whole formal business of understanding and reason into its elements and exhibits them as principles of all logical judging of our cognitions
this part of logic may therefore be called analytic and is at least the negative test of truth because all cognitions must first of an be estimated and tried according to these laws before we proceed to investigate them in respect of their content in order to discover whether they contain positive truth in regard to their object
because however the mere form of a cognition accurately as it may accord with logical laws is insufficient to supply us with material objective truth no one by means of logic alone can venture to predicate anything of or decide concerning objects unless he has obtained independently of logic wellgrounded information about them in order afterwards to examine according to logical laws into the use and connection in a cohering whole of that information or what is still better merely to test it by them
notwithstanding there lies so seductive a charm in the possession of a specious art like thisan art which gives to all our cognitions the form of the understanding although with respect to the content thereof we may be sadly deficientthat general logic which is merely a canon of judgement has been employed as an organon for the actual production or rather for the semblance of production of objective assertions and has thus been grossly misapplied
now general logic in its assumed character of organon is called dialectic
different as are the significations in which the ancients used this term for a science or an art we may safely infer from their actual employment of it that with them it was nothing else than a logic of illusiona sophistical art for giving ignorance nay even intentional sophistries the colouring of truth in which the thoroughness of procedure which logic requires was imitated and their topic employed to cloak the empty pretensions
now it may be taken as a safe and useful warning that general logic considered as an organon must always be a logic of illusion that is be dialectical for as it teaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions but merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects any attempt to employ it as an instrument organon in order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end in mere prating any one being able to maintain or oppose with some appearance of truth any single assertion whatever
such instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy
for these reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic dialectic in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion and we wish the term to be so understood in this place
iv
of the division of transcendental logic into transcendental analytic and dialectic
in transcendental logic we isolate the understanding as in transcendental sthetic the sensibility and select from our cognition merely that part of thought which has its origin in the understanding alone
the exercise of this pure cognition however depends upon this as its condition that objects to which it may be applied be given to us in intuition for without intuition the whole of our cognition is without objects and is therefore quite void
that part of transcendental logic then which treats of the elements of pure cognition of the understanding and of the principles without which no object at all can be thought is transcendental analytic and at the same time a logic of truth
for no cognition can contradict it without losing at the same time all content that is losing all reference to an object and therefore all truth
but because we are very easily seduced into employing these pure cognitions and principles of the understanding by themselves and that even beyond the boundaries of experience which yet is the only source whence we can obtain matter objects on which those pure conceptions may be employedunderstanding runs the risk of making by means of empty sophisms a material and objective use of the mere formal principles of the pure understanding and of passing judgements on objects without distinctionobjects which are not given to us nay perhaps cannot be given to us in any way
now as it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of the empirical use of the understanding this kind of logic is misused when we seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimited exercise of the understanding and attempt with the pure understanding alone to judge synthetically affirm and determine respecting objects in general
in this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomes dialectical
the second part of our transcendental logic must therefore be a critique of dialectical illusion and this critique we shall term transcendental dialecticnot meaning it as an art of producing dogmatically such illusion an art which is unfortunately too current among the practitioners of metaphysical juggling but as a critique of understanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use
this critique will expose the groundless nature of the pretensions of these two faculties and invalidate their claims to the discovery and enlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendental principles and show that the proper employment of these faculties is to test the judgements made by the pure understanding and to guard it from sophistical delusion
first division
transcendental logic
transcendental analytic
transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our priori knowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding
in order to effect our purpose it is necessary that the conceptions be pure and not empirical that they belong not to intuition and sensibility but to thought and understanding that they be elementary conceptions and as such quite different from deduced or compound conceptions that our table of these elementary conceptions be complete and fill up the whole sphere of the pure understanding
now this completeness of a science cannot be accepted with confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence in an aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts
the completeness which we require is possible only by means of an idea of the totality of the priori cognition of the understanding and through the thereby determined division of the conceptions which form the said whole consequently only by means of their connection in a system
pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely from everything empirical but also completely from all sensibility
it is a unity selfsubsistent selfsufficient and not to be enlarged by any additions from without
hence the sum of its cognition constitutes a system to be determined by and comprised under an idea and the completeness and articulation of this system can at the same time serve as a test of the correctness and genuineness of all the parts of cognition that belong to it
the whole of this part of transcendental logic consists of two books of which the one contains the conceptions and the other the principles of pure understanding
book i
analytic of conceptions
by the term analytic of conceptions i do not understand the analysis of these or the usual process in philosophical investigations of dissecting the conceptions which present themselves according to their content and so making them clear but i mean the hitherto little attempted dissection of the faculty of understanding itself in order to investigate the possibility of conceptions priori by looking for them in the understanding alone as their birthplace and analysing the pure use of this faculty
for this is the proper duty of a transcendental philosophy what remains is the logical treatment of the conceptions in philosophy in general
we shall therefore follow up the pure conceptions even to their germs and beginnings in the human understanding in which they lie until they are developed on occasions presented by experience and freed by the same understanding from the empirical conditions attaching to them are set forth in their unalloyed purity
chapter i
of the transcendental clue to the discovery of all pure conceptions of the understanding
introductory
when we call into play a faculty of cognition different conceptions manifest themselves according to the different circumstances and make known this faculty and assemble themselves into a more or less extensive collection according to the time or penetration that has been applied to the consideration of them
where this process conducted as it is mechanically so to speak will end cannot be determined with certainty
besides the conceptions which we discover in this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and systematic unity but are at last coupled together only according to resemblances to each other and arranged in series according to the quantity of their content from the simpler to the more complexseries which are anything but systematic though not altogether without a certain kind of method in their construction
transcendental philosophy has the advantage and moreover the duty of searching for its conceptions according to a principle because these conceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an absolute unity and therefore must be connected with each other according to one conception or idea
a connection of this kind however furnishes us with a ready prepared rule by which its proper place may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding and the completeness of the system of all be determined prioriboth which would otherwise have been dependent on mere choice or chance
section i
of the logical use of the understanding in general
the understanding was defined above only negatively as a nonsensuous faculty of cognition
now independently of sensibility we cannot possibly have any intuition consequently the understanding is no faculty of intuition
but besides intuition there is no other mode of cognition except through conceptions consequently the cognition of every at least of every human understanding is a cognition through conceptionsnot intuitive but discursive
all intuitions as sensuous depend on affections conceptions therefore upon functions
by the word function i understand the unity of the act of arranging diverse representations under one common representation
conceptions then are based on the spontaneity of thought as sensuous intuitions are on the receptivity of impressions
now the understanding cannot make any other use of these conceptions than to judge by means of them
as no representation except an intuition relates immediately to its object a conception never relates immediately to an object but only to some other representation thereof be that an intuition or itself a conception
a judgement therefore is the mediate cognition of an object consequently the representation of a representation of it
in every judgement there is a conception which applies to and is valid for many other conceptions and which among these comprehends also a given representation this last being immediately connected with an object
for example in the judgementall bodies are divisible our conception of divisible applies to various other conceptions among these however it is here particularly applied to the conception of body and this conception of body relates to certain phenomena which occur to us
these objects therefore are mediately represented by the conception of divisibility
all judgements accordingly are functions of unity in our representations inasmuch as instead of an immediate a higher representation which comprises this and various others is used for our cognition of the object and thereby many possible cognitions are collected into one
but we can reduce all acts of the understanding to judgements so that understanding may be represented as the faculty of judging
for it is according to what has been said above a faculty of thought
now thought is cognition by means of conceptions
but conceptions as predicates of possible judgements relate to some representation of a yet undetermined object
thus the conception of body indicates somethingfor example metalwhich can be cognized by means of that conception
it is therefore a conception for the reason alone that other representations are contained under it by means of which it can relate to objects
it is therefore the predicate to a possible judgement for example every metal is a body
all the functions of the understanding therefore can be discovered when we can completely exhibit the functions of unity in judgements
and that this may be effected very easily the following section will show
section ii
of the logical function of the understanding in judgements
if we abstract all the content of a judgement and consider only the intellectual form thereof we find that the function of thought in a judgement can be brought under four heads of which each contains three momenta
these may be conveniently represented in the following table
quantity of judgements universal particular singular
quality relation affirmative categorical negative hypothetical infinite disjunctive
modality problematical assertorical apodeictical
as this division appears to differ in some though not essential points from the usual technique of logicians the following observations for the prevention of otherwise possible misunderstanding will not be without their use
logicians say with justice that in the use of judgements in syllogisms singular judgements may be treated like universal ones
for precisely because a singular judgement has no extent at all its predicate cannot refer to a part of that which is contained in the conception of the subject and be excluded from the rest
the predicate is valid for the whole conception just as if it were a general conception and had extent to the whole of which the predicate applied
on the other hand let us compare a singular with a general judgement merely as a cognition in regard to quantity
the singular judgement relates to the general one as unity to infinity and is therefore in itself essentially different
thus if we estimate a singular judgement judicium singulare not merely according to its intrinsic validity as a judgement but also as a cognition generally according to its quantity in comparison with that of other cognitions it is then entirely different from a general judgement judicium commune and in a complete table of the momenta of thought deserves a separate placethough indeed this would not be necessary in a logic limited merely to the consideration of the use of judgements in reference to each other
in like manner in transcendental logic infinite must be distinguished from affirmative judgements although in general logic they are rightly enough classed under affirmative
general logic abstracts all content of the predicate though it be negative and only considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of the subject
but transcendental logic considers also the worth or content of this logical affirmationan affirmation by means of a merely negative predicate and inquires how much the sum total of our cognition gains by this affirmation
for example if i say of the soul it is not mortalby this negative judgement i should at least ward off error
now by the proposition the soul is not mortal i have in respect of the logical form really affirmed inasmuch as i thereby place the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings
now because of the whole sphere of possible existences the mortal occupies one part and the immortal the other neither more nor less is affirmed by the proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitude of things which remain over when i take away the whole mortal part
but by this proceeding we accomplish only this much that the infinite sphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortal is excluded from it and the soul is placed in the remaining part of the extent of this sphere
but this part remains notwithstanding this exception infinite and more and more parts may be taken away from the whole sphere without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or affirmatively determining our conception of the soul
these judgements therefore infinite in respect of their logical extent are in respect of the content of their cognition merely limitative and are consequently entitled to a place in our transcendental table of all the momenta of thought in judgements because the function of the understanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in the field of its pure priori cognition
all relations of thought in judgements are those a of the predicate to the subject b of the principle to its consequence c of the divided cognition and all the members of the division to each other
in the first of these three classes we consider only two conceptions in the second two judgements in the third several judgements in relation to each other
the hypothetical proposition if perfect justice exists the obstinately wicked are punished contains properly the relation to each other of two propositions namely perfect justice exists and the obstinately wicked are punished
whether these propositions are in themselves true is a question not here decided
nothing is cogitated by means of this judgement except a certain consequence
finally the disjunctive judgement contains a relation of two or more propositions to each othera relation not of consequence but of logical opposition in so far as the sphere of the one proposition excludes that of the other
but it contains at the same time a relation of community in so far as all the propositions taken together fill up the sphere of the cognition
the disjunctive judgement contains therefore the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a cognition since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the sphere of the other each contributing to form the sum total of the divided cognition
take for example the proposition the world exists either through blind chance or through internal necessity or through an external cause
each of these propositions embraces a part of the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world all of them taken together the whole sphere
to take the cognition out of one of these spheres is equivalent to placing it in one of the others and on the other hand to place it in one sphere is equivalent to taking it out of the rest
there is therefore in a disjunctive judgement a certain community of cognitions which consists in this that they mutually exclude each other yet thereby determine as a whole the true cognition inasmuch as taken together they make up the complete content of a particular given cognition
and this is all that i find necessary for the sake of what follows to remark in this place
the modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function with this distinguishing characteristic that it contributes nothing to the content of a judgement for besides quantity quality and relation there is nothing more that constitutes the content of a judgement but concerns itself only with the value of the copula in relation to thought in general
problematical judgements are those in which the affirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible ad libitum
in the assertorical we regard the proposition as real true in the apodeictical we look on it as necessary
thus the two judgements antecedens et consequens the relation of which constitutes a hypothetical judgement likewise those the members of the division in whose reciprocity the disjunctive consists are only problematical
in the example above given the proposition there exists perfect justice is not stated assertorically but as an ad libitum judgement which someone may choose to adopt and the consequence alone is assertorical
hence such judgements may be obviously false and yet taken problematically be conditions of our cognition of the truth
thus the proposition the world exists only by blind chance is in the disjunctive judgement of problematical import only that is to say one may accept it for the moment and it helps us like the indication of the wrong road among all the roads that one can take to find out the true proposition
the problematical proposition is therefore that which expresses only logical possibility which is not objective that is it expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such a propositiona merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding
the assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth as for example in a hypothetical syllogism the antecedens presents itself in a problematical form in the major in an assertorical form in the minor and it shows that the proposition is in harmony with the laws of the understanding
the apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertorical as determined by these very laws of the understanding consequently as affirming priori and in this manner it expresses logical necessity
now because all is here gradually incorporated with the understandinginasmuch as in the first place we judge problematically then accept assertorically our judgement as true lastly affirm it as inseparably united with the understanding that is as necessary and apodeicticalwe may safely reckon these three functions of modality as so many momenta of thought
just as if thought were in the first instance a function of the understanding in the second of judgement in the third of reason
a remark which will be explained in the sequel
section iii
of the pure conceptions of the understanding or categories
general logic as has been repeatedly said makes abstraction of all content of cognition and expects to receive representations from some other quarter in order by means of analysis to convert them into conceptions
on the contrary transcendental logic has lying before it the manifold content of priori sensibility which transcendental sthetic presents to it in order to give matter to the pure conceptions of the understanding without which transcendental logic would have no content and be therefore utterly void
now space and time contain an infinite diversity of determinations of pure priori intuition but are nevertheless the condition of the minds receptivity under which alone it can obtain representations of objects and which consequently must always affect the conception of these objects
but the spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined after a certain manner received into the mind and connected in order afterwards to form a cognition out of it
this process i call synthesis
by the word synthesis in its most general signification i understand the process of joining different representations to each other and of comprehending their diversity in one cognition
this synthesis is pure when the diversity is not given empirically but priori as that in space and time
our representations must be given previously to any analysis of them and no conceptions can arise quoad their content analytically
but the synthesis of a diversity be it given priori or empirically is the first requisite for the production of a cognition which in its beginning indeed may be crude and confused and therefore in need of analysisstill synthesis is that by which alone the elements of our cognitions are collected and united into a certain content consequently it is the first thing on which we must fix our attention if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge
synthesis generally speaking is as we shall afterwards see the mere operation of the imaginationa blind but indispensable function of the soul without which we should have no cognition whatever but of the working of which we are seldom even conscious
but to reduce this synthesis to conceptions is a function of the understanding by means of which we attain to cognition in the proper meaning of the term
pure synthesis represented generally gives us the pure conception of the understanding
but by this pure synthesis i mean that which rests upon a basis of priori synthetical unity
thus our numeration and this is more observable in large numbers is a synthesis according to conceptions because it takes place according to a common basis of unity for example the decade
by means of this conception therefore the unity in the synthesis of the manifold becomes necessary
by means of analysis different representations are brought under one conceptionan operation of which general logic treats
on the other hand the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions not representations but the pure synthesis of representations
the first thing which must be given to us for the sake of the priori cognition of all objects is the diversity of the pure intuition the synthesis of this diversity by means of the imagination is the second but this gives as yet no cognition
the conceptions which give unity to this pure synthesis and which consist solely in the representation of this necessary synthetical unity furnish the third requisite for the cognition of an object and these conceptions are given by the understanding
the same function which gives unity to the different representation in a judgement gives also unity to the mere synthesis of different representations in an intuition and this unity we call the pure conception of the understanding
thus the same understanding and by the same operations whereby in conceptions by means of analytical unity it produced the logical form of a judgement introduces by means of the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition a transcendental content into its representations on which account they are called pure conceptions of the understanding and they apply priori to objects a result not within the power of general logic
in this manner there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of the understanding applying priori to objects of intuition in general as there are logical functions in all possible judgements
for there is no other function or faculty existing in the understanding besides those enumerated in that table
these conceptions we shall with aristotle call categories our purpose being originally identical with his notwithstanding the great difference in the execution
table of the categories
of quantity of quality unity reality plurality negation totality limitation
of relation of inherence and subsistence substantia et accidens of causality and dependence cause and effect of community reciprocity between the agent and patient
of modality possibilitymdashimpossibility existencemdashnonexistence necessitymdashcontingence
this then is a catalogue of all the originally pure conceptions of the synthesis which the understanding contains priori and these conceptions alone entitle it to be called a pure understanding inasmuch as only by them it can render the manifold of intuition conceivable in other words think an object of intuition
this division is made systematically from a common principle namely the faculty of judgement which is just the same as the power of thought and has not arisen rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after pure conceptions respecting the full number of which we never could be certain inasmuch as we employ induction alone in our search without considering that in this way we can never understand wherefore precisely these conceptions and none others abide in the pure understanding
it was a design worthy of an acute thinker like aristotle to search for these fundamental conceptions
destitute however of any guiding principle he picked them up just as they occurred to him and at first hunted out ten which he called categories predicaments
afterwards be believed that he had discovered five others which were added under the name of post predicaments
but his catalogue still remained defective
besides there are to be found among them some of the modes of pure sensibility quando ubi situs also prius simul and likewise an empirical conception motuswhich can by no means belong to this genealogical register of the pure understanding
moreover there are deduced conceptions actio passio enumerated among the original conceptions and of the latter some are entirely wanting
with regard to these it is to be remarked that the categories as the true primitive conceptions of the pure understanding have also their pure deduced conceptions which in a complete system of transcendental philosophy must by no means be passed over though in a merely critical essay we must be contented with the simple mention of the fact
let it be allowed me to call these pure but deduced conceptions of the understanding the predicables of the pure understanding in contradistinction to predicaments
if we are in possession of the original and primitive the deduced and subsidiary conceptions can easily be added and the genealogical tree of the understanding completely delineated
as my present aim is not to set forth a complete system but merely the principles of one i reserve this task for another time
it may be easily executed by any one who will refer to the ontological manuals and subordinate to the category of causality for example the predicables of force action passion to that of community those of presence and resistance to the categories of modality those of origination extinction change and so with the rest
the categories combined with the modes of pure sensibility or with one another afford a great number of deduced priori conceptions a complete enumeration of which would be a useful and not unpleasant but in this place a perfectly dispensable occupation
i purposely omit the definitions of the categories in this treatise
i shall analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for the doctrine of method which is to form a part of this critique
in a system of pure reason definitions of them would be with justice demanded of me but to give them here would only bide from our view the main aim of our investigation at the same time raising doubts and objections the consideration of which without injustice to our main purpose may be very well postponed till another opportunity
meanwhile it ought to be sufficiently clear from the little we have already said on this subject that the formation of a complete vocabulary of pure conceptions accompanied by all the requisite explanations is not only a possible but an easy undertaking
the compartments already exist it is only necessary to fill them up and a systematic topic like the present indicates with perfect precision the proper place to which each conception belongs while it readily points out any that have not yet been filled up
our table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance which may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientific form of all rational cognitions
for that this table is useful in the theoretical part of philosophy nay indispensable for the sketching of the complete plan of a science so far as that science rests upon conceptions priori and for dividing it mathematically according to fixed principles is most manifest from the fact that it contains all the elementary conceptions of the understanding nay even the form of a system of these in the understanding itself and consequently indicates all the momenta and also the internal arrangement of a projected speculative science as i have elsewhere shown
here follow some of these observations
in the metaphysical principles of natural science
i
this table which contains four classes of conceptions of the understanding may in the first instance be divided into two classes the first of which relates to objects of intuitionpure as well as empirical the second to the existence of these objects either in relation to one another or to the understanding
the former of these classes of categories i would entitle the mathematical and the latter the dynamical categories
the former as we see has no correlates these are only to be found in the second class
this difference must have a ground in the nature of the human understanding
ii
the number of the categories in each class is always the same namely threea fact which also demands some consideration because in all other cases division priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy
it is to be added that the third category in each triad always arises from the combination of the second with the first
thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation community is the causality of a substance reciprocally determining and determined by other substances and finally necessity is nothing but existence which is given through the possibility itself
let it not be supposed however that the third category is merely a deduced and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding
for the conjunction of the first and second in order to produce the third conception requires a particular function of the understanding which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second
thus the conception of a number which belongs to the category of totality is not always possible where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist for example in the representation of the infinite
or if i conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance it does not follow that the conception of influence that is how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance will be understood from that
thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary and so in the other instances
iii
with respect to one category namely that of community which is found in the third class it is not so easy as with the others to detect its accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement which corresponds to it in the table of the logical functions
in order to assure ourselves of this accordance we must observe that in every disjunctive judgement the sphere of the judgement that is the complex of all that is contained in it is represented as a whole divided into parts and since one part cannot be contained in the other they are cogitated as coordinated with not subordinated to each other so that they do not determine each other unilaterally as in a linear series but reciprocally as in an aggregateif one member of the division is posited all the rest are excluded and conversely
now a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things for one thing is not subordinated as effect to another as cause of its existence but on the contrary is coordinated contemporaneously and reciprocally as a cause in relation to the determination of the others for example in a bodythe parts of which mutually attract and repel each other
and this is an entirely different kind of connection from that which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect the principle to the consequence for in such a connection the consequence does not in its turn determine the principle and therefore does not constitute with the latter a wholejust as the creator does not with the world make up a whole
the process of understanding by which it represents to itself the sphere of a divided conception is employed also when we think of a thing as divisible and in the same manner as the members of the division in the former exclude one another and yet are connected in one sphere so the understanding represents to itself the parts of the latter as havingeach of theman existence as substances independently of the others and yet as united in one whole
in the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one more leading division which contains pure conceptions of the understanding and which although not numbered among the categories ought according to them as conceptions priori to be valid of objects
but in this case they would augment the number of the categories which cannot be
these are set forth in the proposition so renowned among the schoolmenquodlibet ens est unum verum bonum
now though the inferences from this principle were mere tautological propositions and though it is allowed only by courtesy to retain a place in modern metaphysics yet a thought which maintained itself for such a length of time however empty it seems to be deserves an investigation of its origin and justifies the conjecture that it must be grounded in some law of the understanding which as is often the case has only been erroneously interpreted
these pretended transcendental predicates are in fact nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all cognition of objects and they employ as the basis for this cognition the categories of quantity namely unity plurality and totality
but these which must be taken as material conditions that is as belonging to the possibility of things themselves they employed merely in a formal signification as belonging to the logical requisites of all cognition and yet most unguardedly changed these criteria of thought into properties of objects as things in themselves
now in every cognition of an object there is unity of conception which may be called qualitative unity so far as by this term we understand only the unity in our connection of the manifold for example unity of the theme in a play an oration or a story
secondly there is truth in respect of the deductions from it
the more true deductions we have from a given conception the more criteria of its objective reality
this we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks which belong to a conception as to a common foundation but are not cogitated as a quantity in it
thirdly there is perfectionwhich consists in this that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the conception and accords completely with that conception and with no other
this we may denominate qualitative completeness
hence it is evident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition are merely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed to suit an unauthorized manner of applying them
that is to say the three categories in which the unity in the production of the quantum must be homogeneous throughout are transformed solely with a view to the connection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act of consciousness by means of the quality of the cognition which is the principle of that connection
thus the criterion of the possibility of a conception not of its object is the definition of it in which the unity of the conception the truth of all that may be immediately deduced from it and finally the completeness of what has been thus deduced constitute the requisites for the reproduction of the whole conception
thus also the criterion or test of an hypothesis is the intelligibility of the received principle of explanation or its unity without help from any subsidiary hypothesisthe truth of our deductions from it consistency with each other and with experienceand lastly the completeness of the principle of the explanation of these deductions which refer to neither more nor less than what was admitted in the hypothesis restoring analytically and posteriori what was cogitated synthetically and priori
by the conceptions therefore of unity truth and perfection we have made no addition to the transcendental table of the categories which is complete without them
we have on the contrary merely employed the three categories of quantity setting aside their application to objects of experience as general logical laws of the consistency of cognition with itself
chapter ii
of the deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding
section i
of the principles of a transcendental deduction in general
teachers of jurisprudence when speaking of rights and claims distinguish in a cause the question of right quid juris from the question of fact quid facti and while they demand proof of both they give to the proof of the former which goes to establish right or claim in law the name of deduction
now we make use of a great number of empirical conceptions without opposition from any one and consider ourselves even without any attempt at deduction justified in attaching to them a sense and a supposititious signification because we have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective reality
there exist also however usurped conceptions such as fortune fate which circulate with almost universal indulgence and yet are occasionally challenged by the question quid juris in such cases we have great difficulty in discovering any deduction for these terms inasmuch as we cannot produce any manifest ground of right either from experience or from reason on which the claim to employ them can be founded
among the many conceptions which make up the very variegated web of human cognition some are destined for pure use priori independent of all experience and their title to be so employed always requires a deduction inasmuch as to justify such use of them proofs from experience are not sufficient but it is necessary to know how these conceptions can apply to objects without being derived from experience
i term therefore an examination of the manner in which conceptions can apply priori to objects the transcendental deduction of conceptions and i distinguish it from the empirical deduction which indicates the mode in which conception is obtained through experience and reflection thereon consequently does not concern itself with the right but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in such and such a manner
we have already seen that we are in possession of two perfectly different kinds of conceptions which nevertheless agree with each other in this that they both apply to objects completely priori
these are the conceptions of space and time as forms of sensibility and the categories as pure conceptions of the understanding
to attempt an empirical deduction of either of these classes would be labour in vain because the distinguishing characteristic of their nature consists in this that they apply to their objects without having borrowed anything from experience towards the representation of them
consequently if a deduction of these conceptions is necessary it must always be transcendental
meanwhile with respect to these conceptions as with respect to all our cognition we certainly may discover in experience if not the principle of their possibility yet the occasioning causes of their production
it will be found that the impressions of sense give the first occasion for bringing into action the whole faculty of cognition and for the production of experience which contains two very dissimilar elements namely a matter for cognition given by the senses and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter arising out of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought and these on occasion given by sensuous impressions are called into exercise and produce conceptions
such an investigation into the first efforts of our faculty of cognition to mount from particular perceptions to general conceptions is undoubtedly of great utility and we have to thank the celebrated locke for having first opened the way for this inquiry
but a deduction of the pure priori conceptions of course never can be made in this way seeing that in regard to their future employment which must be entirely independent of experience they must have a far different certificate of birth to show from that of a descent from experience
this attempted physiological derivation which cannot properly be called deduction because it relates merely to a quaestio facti i shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a pure cognition
it is therefore manifest that there can only be a transcendental deduction of these conceptions and by no means an empirical one also that all attempts at an empirical deduction in regard to pure priori conceptions are vain and can only be made by one who does not understand the altogether peculiar nature of these cognitions
but although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure priori cognition is a transcendental deduction it is not for that reason perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutely necessary
we have already traced to their sources the conceptions of space and time by means of a transcendental deduction and we have explained and determined their objective validity priori
geometry nevertheless advances steadily and securely in the province of pure priori cognitions without needing to ask from philosophy any certificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamental conception of space
but the use of the conception in this science extends only to the external world of sense the pure form of the intuition of which is space and in this world therefore all geometrical cognition because it is founded upon priori intuition possesses immediate evidence and the objects of this cognition are given priori as regards their form in intuition by and through the cognition itself
with the pure conceptions of understanding on the contrary commences the absolute necessity of seeking a transcendental deduction not only of these conceptions themselves but likewise of space because inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning objects not by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility but of pure thought priori they apply to objects without any of the conditions of sensibility
besides not being founded on experience they are not presented with any object in priori intuition upon which antecedently to experience they might base their synthesis
hence results not only doubt as to the objective validity and proper limits of their use but that even our conception of space is rendered equivocal inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of the categories to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditions of sensuous intuitionand for this reason we have already found a transcendental deduction of it needful
the reader then must be quite convinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction before taking a single step in the field of pure reason because otherwise he goes to work blindly and after he has wondered about in all directions returns to the state of utter ignorance from which he started
he ought moreover clearly to recognize beforehand the unavoidable difficulties in his undertaking so that he may not afterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself is deeply involved or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in his path because we have a choice of only two thingseither at once to give up all pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience or to bring this critical investigation to completion
we have been able with very little trouble to make it comprehensible how the conceptions of space and time although priori cognitions must necessarily apply to external objects and render a synthetical cognition of these possible independently of all experience
for inasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an object can appear to us that is be an object of empirical intuition space and time are pure intuitions which contain priori the condition of the possibility of objects as phenomena and an priori synthesis in these intuitions possesses objective validity
on the other hand the categories of the understanding do not represent the conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition objects can consequently appear to us without necessarily connecting themselves with these and consequently without any necessity binding on the understanding to contain priori the conditions of these objects
thus we find ourselves involved in a difficulty which did not present itself in the sphere of sensibility that is to say we cannot discover how the subjective conditions of thought can have objective validity in other words can become conditions of the possibility of all cognition of objects for phenomena may certainly be given to us in intuition without any help from the functions of the understanding
let us take for example the conception of cause which indicates a peculiar kind of synthesis namely that with something a something entirely different b is connected according to a law
it is not priori manifest why phenomena should contain anything of this kind we are of course debarred from appealing for proof to experience for the objective validity of this conception must be demonstrated priori and it hence remains doubtful priori whether such a conception be not quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomena
for that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal conditions of sensibility existing priori in the mind is quite evident from the fact that without these they could not be objects for us but that they must also correspond to the conditions which understanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought is an assertion the grounds for which are not so easily to be discovered
for phenomena might be so constituted as not to correspond to the conditions of the unity of thought and all things might lie in such confusion that for example nothing could be met with in the sphere of phenomena to suggest a law of synthesis and so correspond to the conception of cause and effect so that this conception would be quite void null and without significance
phenomena would nevertheless continue to present objects to our intuition for mere intuition does not in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought
if we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigations by saying experience is constantly offering us examples of the relation of cause and effect in phenomena and presents us with abundant opportunity of abstracting the conception of cause and so at the same time of corroborating the objective validity of this conception we should in this case be overlooking the fact that the conception of cause cannot arise in this way at all that on the contrary it must either have an priori basis in the understanding or be rejected as a mere chimera
for this conception demands that something a should be of such a nature that something else b should follow from it necessarily and according to an absolutely universal law
we may certainly collect from phenomena a law according to which this or that usually happens but the element of necessity is not to be found in it
hence it is evident that to the synthesis of cause and effect belongs a dignity which is utterly wanting in any empirical synthesis for it is no mere mechanical synthesis by means of addition but a dynamical one that is to say the effect is not to be cogitated as merely annexed to the cause but as posited by and through the cause and resulting from it
the strict universality of this law never can be a characteristic of empirical laws which obtain through induction only a comparative universality that is an extended range of practical application
but the pure conceptions of the understanding would entirely lose all their peculiar character if we treated them merely as the productions of experience
transition to the transcendental deduction of the categories
there are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation and its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other and as it were meet together
either the object alone makes the representation possible or the representation alone makes the object possible
in the former case the relation between them is only empirical and an priori representation is impossible
and this is the case with phenomena as regards that in them which is referable to mere sensation
in the latter casealthough representation alone for of its causality by means of the will we do not here speak does not produce the object as to its existence it must nevertheless be priori determinative in regard to the object if it is only by means of the representation that we can cognize anything as an object
now there are only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects firstly intuition by means of which the object though only as phenomenon is given secondly conception by means of which the object which corresponds to this intuition is thought
but it is evident from what has been said on sthetic that the first condition under which alone objects can be intuited must in fact exist as a formal basis for them priori in the mind
with this formal condition of sensibility therefore all phenomena necessarily correspond because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all that is can be empirically intuited and given
now the question is whether there do not exist priori in the mind conceptions of understanding also as conditions under which alone something if not intuited is yet thought as object
if this question be answered in the affirmative it follows that all empirical cognition of objects is necessarily conformable to such conceptions since if they are not presupposed it is impossible that anything can be an object of experience
now all experience contains besides the intuition of the senses through which an object is given a conception also of an object that is given in intuition
accordingly conceptions of objects in general must lie as priori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition and consequently the objective validity of the categories as priori conceptions will rest upon this that experience as far as regards the form of thought is possible only by their means
for in that case they apply necessarily and priori to objects of experience because only through them can an object of experience be thought
the whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all priori conceptions is to show that these conceptions are priori conditions of the possibility of all experience
conceptions which afford us the objective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that very reason necessary
but the analysis of the experiences in which they are met with is not deduction but only an illustration of them because from experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity
without their original applicability and relation to all possible experience in which all objects of cognition present themselves the relation of the categories to objects of whatever nature would be quite incomprehensible
the celebrated locke for want of due reflection on these points and because he met with pure conceptions of the understanding in experience sought also to deduce them from experience and yet proceeded so inconsequently as to attempt with their aid to arrive it cognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all experience
david hume perceived that to render this possible it was necessary that the conceptions should have an priori origin
but as he could not explain how it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with each other in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarily connected in the objectand it never occurred to him that the understanding itself might perhaps by means of these conceptions be the author of the experience in which its objects were presented to ithe was forced to drive these conceptions from experience that is from a subjective necessity arising from repeated association of experiences erroneously considered to be objectivein one word from habit
but he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to be impossible with such conceptions and the principles arising from them to overstep the limits of experience
the empirical derivation however which both of these philosophers attributed to these conceptions cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we do possess scientific priori cognitions namely those of pure mathematics and general physics
the former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to extravagancefor if reason has once undoubted right on its side it will not allow itself to be confined to set limits by vague recommendations of moderation the latter gave himself up entirely to scepticisma natural consequence after having discovered as he thought that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy
we now intend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct reason between these two rocks to assign her determinate limits and yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity
i shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are
they are conceptions of an object in general by means of which its intuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement
the following will make this plain
the function of the categorical judgement is that of the relation of subject to predicate for example in the proposition all bodies are divisible
but in regard to the merely logical use of the understanding it still remains undetermined to which of these two conceptions belongs the function of subject and to which that of predicate
for we could also say some divisible is a body
but the category of substance when the conception of a body is brought under it determines that and its empirical intuition in experience must be contemplated always as subject and never as mere predicate
and so with all the other categories
section ii transcendental deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding
of the possibility of a conjunction of the manifold representations given by sense
the manifold content in our representations can be given in an intuition which is merely sensuousin other words is nothing but susceptibility and the form of this intuition can exist priori in our faculty of representation without being anything else but the mode in which the subject is affected
but the conjunction conjunctio of a manifold in intuition never can be given us by the senses it cannot therefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous intuition for it is a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation
and as we must to distinguish it from sensibility entitle this faculty understanding so all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious be it of the manifold in intuition sensuous or nonsensuous or of several conceptionsis an act of the understanding
to this act we shall give the general appellation of synthesis thereby to indicate at the same time that we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the object without having previously conjoined it ourselves
of all mental notions that of conjunction is the only one which cannot be given through objects but can be originated only by the subject itself because it is an act of its purely spontaneous activity
the reader will easily enough perceive that the possibility of conjunction must be grounded in the very nature of this act and that it must be equally valid for all conjunction and that analysis which appears to be its contrary must nevertheless always presuppose it for where the understanding has not previously conjoined it cannot dissect or analyse because only as conjoined by it must that which is to be analysed have been given to our faculty of representation
but the conception of conjunction includes besides the conception of the manifold and of the synthesis of it that of the unity of it also
conjunction is the representation of the synthetical unity of the manifold
this idea of unity therefore cannot arise out of that of conjunction much rather does that idea by combining itself with the representation of the manifold render the conception of conjunction possible
this unity which priori precedes all conceptions of conjunction is not the category of unity for all the categories are based upon logical functions of judgement and in these functions we already have conjunction and consequently unity of given conceptions
it is therefore evident that the category of unity presupposes conjunction
we must therefore look still higher for this unity as qualitative in that namely which contains the ground of the unity of diverse conceptions in judgements the ground consequently of the possibility of the existence of the understanding even in regard to its logical use
whether the representations are in themselves identical and consequently whether one can be thought analytically by means of and through the other is a question which we need not at present consider
our consciousness of the one when we speak of the manifold is always distinguishable from our consciousness of the other and it is only respecting the synthesis of this possible consciousness that we here treat
of the originally synthetical unity of apperception
the i think must accompany all my representations for otherwise something would be represented in me which could not be thought in other words the representation would either be impossible or at least be in relation to me nothing
that representation which can be given previously to all thought is called intuition
all the diversity or manifold content of intuition has therefore a necessary relation to the i think in the subject in which this diversity is found
but this representation i think is an act of spontaneity that is to say it cannot be regarded as belonging to mere sensibility
i call it pure apperception in order to distinguish it from empirical or primitive apperception because it is selfconsciousness which whilst it gives birth to the representation i think must necessarily be capable of accompanying all our representations
it is in all acts of consciousness one and the same and unaccompanied by it no representation can exist for me
the unity of this apperception i call the transcendental unity of selfconsciousness in order to indicate the possibility of priori cognition arising from it
for the manifold representations which are given in an intuition would not all of them be my representations if they did not all belong to one selfconsciousness that is as my representations even although i am not conscious of them as such they must conform to the condition under which alone they can exist together in a common selfconsciousness because otherwise they would not all without exception belong to me
from this primitive conjunction follow many important results
for example this universal identity of the apperception of the manifold given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and is possible only by means of the consciousness of this synthesis
for the empirical consciousness which accompanies different representations is in itself fragmentary and disunited and without relation to the identity of the subject
this relation then does not exist because i accompany every representation with consciousness but because i join one representation to another and am conscious of the synthesis of them
consequently only because i can connect a variety of given representations in one consciousness is it possible that i can represent to myself the identity of consciousness in these representations in other words the analytical unity of apperception is possible only under the presupposition of a synthetical unity
the thought these representations given in intuition belong all of them to me is accordingly just the same as i unite them in one selfconsciousness or can at least so unite them and although this thought is not itself the consciousness of the synthesis of representations it presupposes the possibility of it that is to say for the reason alone that i can comprehend the variety of my representations in one consciousness do i call them my representations for otherwise i must have as manycoloured and various a self as are the representations of which i am conscious
synthetical unity of the manifold in intuitions as given priori is therefore the foundation of the identity of apperception itself which antecedes priori all determinate thought
but the conjunction of representations into a conception is not to be found in objects themselves nor can it be as it were borrowed from them and taken up into the understanding by perception but it is on the contrary an operation of the understanding itself which is nothing more than the faculty of conjoining priori and of bringing the variety of given representations under the unity of apperception
this principle is the highest in all human cognition
all general conceptionsas suchdepend for their existence on the analytical unity of consciousness
for example when i think of red in general i thereby think to myself a property which as a characteristic mark can be discovered somewhere or can be united with other representations consequently it is only by means of a forethought possible synthetical unity that i can think to myself the analytical
a representation which is cogitated as common to different representations is regarded as belonging to such as besides this common representation contain something different consequently it must be previously thought in synthetical unity with other although only possible representations before i can think in it the analytical unity of consciousness which makes it a conceptas communis
and thus the synthetical unity of apperception is the highest point with which we must connect every operation of the understanding even the whole of logic and after it our transcendental philosophy indeed this faculty is the understanding itself
this fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception is indeed an identical and therefore analytical proposition but it nevertheless explains the necessity for a synthesis of the manifold given in an intuition without which the identity of selfconsciousness would be incogitable
for the ego as a simple representation presents us with no manifold content only in intuition which is quite different from the representation ego can it be given us and by means of conjunction it is cogitated in one selfconsciousness
an understanding in which all the manifold should be given by means of consciousness itself would be intuitive our understanding can only think and must look for its intuition to sense
i am therefore conscious of my identical self in relation to all the variety of representations given to me in an intuition because i call all of them my representations
in other words i am conscious myself of a necessary priori synthesis of my representations which is called the original synthetical unity of apperception under which rank all the representations presented to me but that only by means of a synthesis
the principle of the synthetical unity of apperception is the highest principle of all exercise of the understanding
the supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to sensibility was according to our transcendental sthetic that all the manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of space and time
the supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to the understanding is that all the manifold in it be subject to conditions of the originally synthetical unity or apperception
to the former of these two principles are subject all the various representations of intuition in so far as they are given to us to the latter in so far as they must be capable of conjunction in one consciousness for without this nothing can be thought or cognized because the given representations would not have in common the act of the apperception i think and therefore could not be connected in one selfconsciousness
space and time and all portions thereof are intuitions consequently are with a manifold for their content single representations
see the transcendental sthetic
consequently they are not pure conceptions by means of which the same consciousness is found in a great number of representations but on the contrary they are many representations contained in one the consciousness of which is so to speak compounded
the unity of consciousness is nevertheless synthetical and therefore primitive
from this peculiar character of consciousness follow many important consequences
see
understanding is to speak generally the faculty of cognitions
these consist in the determined relation of given representation to an object
but an object is that in the conception of which the manifold in a given intuition is united
now all union of representations requires unity of consciousness in the synthesis of them
consequently it is the unity of consciousness alone that constitutes the possibility of representations relating to an object and therefore of their objective validity and of their becoming cognitions and consequently the possibility of the existence of the understanding itself
the first pure cognition of understanding then upon which is founded all its other exercise and which is at the same time perfectly independent of all conditions of mere sensuous intuition is the principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception
thus the mere form of external sensuous intuition namely space affords us per se no cognition it merely contributes the manifold in priori intuition to a possible cognition
but in order to cognize something in space for example a line i must draw it and thus produce synthetically a determined conjunction of the given manifold so that the unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness in the conception of a line and by this means alone is an object a determinate space cognized
the synthetical unity of consciousness is therefore an objective condition of all cognition which i do not merely require in order to cognize an object but to which every intuition must necessarily be subject in order to become an object for me because in any other way and without this synthesis the manifold in intuition could not be united in one consciousness
this proposition is as already said itself analytical although it constitutes the synthetical unity the condition of all thought for it states nothing more than that all my representations in any given intuition must be subject to the condition which alone enables me to connect them as my representation with the identical self and so to unite them synthetically in one apperception by means of the general expression i think
but this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for every possible understanding but only for the understanding by means of whose pure apperception in the thought i am no manifold content is given
the understanding or mind which contained the manifold in intuition in and through the act itself of its own selfconsciousness in other words an understanding by and in the representation of which the objects of the representation should at the same time exist would not require a special act of synthesis of the manifold as the condition of the unity of its consciousness an act of which the human understanding which thinks only and cannot intuite has absolute need
but this principle is the first principle of all the operations of our understanding so that we cannot form the least conception of any other possible understanding either of one such as should be itself intuition or possess a sensuous intuition but with forms different from those of space and time
what objective unity of selfconsciousness is
it is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the manifold given in an intuition is united into a conception of the object
on this account it is called objective and must be distinguished from the subjective unity of consciousness which is a determination of the internal sense by means of which the said manifold in intuition is given empirically to be so united
whether i can be empirically conscious of the manifold as coexistent or as successive depends upon circumstances or empirical conditions
hence the empirical unity of consciousness by means of association of representations itself relates to a phenomenal world and is wholly contingent
on the contrary the pure form of intuition in time merely as an intuition which contains a given manifold is subject to the original unity of consciousness and that solely by means of the necessary relation of the manifold in intuition to the i think consequently by means of the pure synthesis of the understanding which lies priori at the foundation of all empirical synthesis
the transcendental unity of apperception is alone objectively valid the empirical which we do not consider in this essay and which is merely a unity deduced from the former under given conditions in concreto possesses only subjective validity
one person connects the notion conveyed in a word with one thing another with another thing and the unity of consciousness in that which is empirical is in relation to that which is given by experience not necessarily and universally valid
the logical form of all judgements consists in the objective unity of apperception of the conceptions contained therein
i could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians give of a judgement
it is according to them the representation of a relation between two conceptions
i shall not dwell here on the faultiness of this definition in that it suits only for categorical and not for hypothetical or disjunctive judgements these latter containing a relation not of conceptions but of judgements themselvesa blunder from which many evil results have followed
it is more important for our present purpose to observe that this definition does not determine in what the said relation consists
the tedious doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns only categorical syllogisms and although it is nothing more than an artifice by surreptitiously introducing immediate conclusions consequentiae immediatae among the premises of a pure syllogism to give ism give rise to an appearance of more modes of drawing a conclusion than that in the first figure the artifice would not have had much success had not its authors succeeded in bringing categorical judgements into exclusive respect as those to which all others must be referreda doctrine however which according to is utterly false
but if i investigate more closely the relation of given cognitions in every judgement and distinguish it as belonging to the understanding from the relation which is produced according to laws of the reproductive imagination which has only subjective validity i find that judgement is nothing but the mode of bringing given cognitions under the objective unit of apperception
this is plain from our use of the term of relation is in judgements in order to distinguish the objective unity of given representations from the subjective unity
for this term indicates the relation of these representations to the original apperception and also their necessary unity even although the judgement is empirical therefore contingent as in the judgement all bodies are heavy
i do not mean by this that these representations do necessarily belong to each other in empirical intuition but that by means of the necessary unity of appreciation they belong to each other in the synthesis of intuitions that is to say they belong to each other according to principles of the objective determination of all our representations in so far as cognition can arise from them these principles being all deduced from the main principle of the transcendental unity of apperception
in this way alone can there arise from this relation a judgement that is a relation which has objective validity and is perfectly distinct from that relation of the very same representations which has only subjective validitya relation to wit which is produced according to laws of association
according to these laws i could only say when i hold in my hand or carry a body i feel an impression of weight but i could not say it the body is heavy for this is tantamount to saying both these representations are conjoined in the object that is without distinction as to the condition of the subject and do not merely stand together in my perception however frequently the perceptive act may be repeated
all sensuous intuitions are subject to the categories as conditions under which alone the manifold content of them can be united in one consciousness
the manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarily under the original synthetical unity of apperception because thereby alone is the unity of intuition possible
but that act of the understanding by which the manifold content of given representations whether intuitions or conceptions is brought under one apperception is the logical function of judgements
all the manifold therefore in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition is determined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement by means of which it is brought into union in one consciousness
now the categories are nothing else than these functions of judgement so far as the manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them
consequently the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily subject to the categories of the understanding
observation
the manifold in an intuition which i call mine is represented by means of the synthesis of the understanding as belonging to the necessary unity of selfconsciousness and this takes place by means of the category
the category indicates accordingly that the empirical consciousness of a given manifold in an intuition is subject to a pure selfconsciousness priori in the same manner as an empirical intuition is subject to a pure sensuous intuition which is also priori
in the above proposition then lies the beginning of a deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding
now as the categories have their origin in the understanding alone independently of sensibility i must in my deduction make abstraction of the mode in which the manifold of an empirical intuition is given in order to fix my attention exclusively on the unity which is brought by the understanding into the intuition by means of the category
in what follows it will be shown from the mode in which the empirical intuition is given in the faculty of sensibility that the unity which belongs to it is no other than that which the category according to imposes on the manifold in a given intuition and thus its priori validity in regard to all objects of sense being established the purpose of our deduction will be fully attained
the proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition by means of which an object is given and which always includes in itself a synthesis of the manifold to be intuited and also the relation of this latter to unity of apperception
but there is one thing in the above demonstration of which i could not make abstraction namely that the manifold to be intuited must be given previously to the synthesis of the understanding and independently of it
how this takes place remains here undetermined
for if i cogitate an understanding which was itself intuitive as for example a divine understanding which should not represent given objects but by whose representation the objects themselves should be given or produced the categories would possess no significance in relation to such a faculty of cognition
they are merely rules for an understanding whose whole power consists in thought that is in the act of submitting the synthesis of the manifold which is presented to it in intuition from a very different quarter to the unity of apperception a faculty therefore which cognizes nothing per se but only connects and arranges the material of cognition the intuition namely which must be presented to it by means of the object
but to show reasons for this peculiar character of our understandings that it produces unity of apperception priori only by means of categories and a certain kind and number thereof is as impossible as to explain why we are endowed with precisely so many functions of judgement and no more or why time and space are the only forms of our intuition
in cognition its application to objects of experience is the only legitimate use of the category
to think an object and to cognize an object are by no means the same thing
in cognition there are two elements firstly the conception whereby an object is cogitated the category and secondly the intuition whereby the object is given
for supposing that to the conception a corresponding intuition could not be given it would still be a thought as regards its form but without any object and no cognition of anything would be possible by means of it inasmuch as so far as i knew there existed and could exist nothing to which my thought could be applied
now all intuition possible to us is sensuous consequently our thought of an object by means of a pure conception of the understanding can become cognition for us only in so far as this conception is applied to objects of the senses
sensuous intuition is either pure intuition space and time or empirical intuitionof that which is immediately represented in space and time by means of sensation as real
through the determination of pure intuition we obtain priori cognitions of objects as in mathematics but only as regards their form as phenomena whether there can exist things which must be intuited in this form is not thereby established
all mathematical conceptions therefore are not per se cognition except in so far as we presuppose that there exist things which can only be represented conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition
but things in space and time are given only in so far as they are perceptions representations accompanied with sensation therefore only by empirical representation
consequently the pure conceptions of the understanding even when they are applied to intuitions priori as in mathematics produce cognition only in so far as these and therefore the conceptions of the understanding by means of them can be applied to empirical intuitions
consequently the categories do not even by means of pure intuition afford us any cognition of things they can only do so in so far as they can be applied to empirical intuition
that is to say the categories serve only to render empirical cognition possible
but this is what we call experience
consequently in cognition their application to objects of experience is the only legitimate use of the categories
the foregoing proposition is of the utmost importance for it determines the limits of the exercise of the pure conceptions of the understanding in regard to objects just as transcendental sthetic determined the limits of the exercise of the pure form of our sensuous intuition
space and time as conditions of the possibility of the presentation of objects to us are valid no further than for objects of sense consequently only for experience
beyond these limits they represent to us nothing for they belong only to sense and have no reality apart from it
the pure conceptions of the understanding are free from this limitation and extend to objects of intuition in general be the intuition like or unlike to ours provided only it be sensuous and not intellectual
but this extension of conceptions beyond the range of our intuition is of no advantage for they are then mere empty conceptions of objects as to the possibility or impossibility of the existence of which they furnish us with no means of discovery
they are mere forms of thought without objective reality because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity of apperception which alone the categories contain could be applied for the purpose of determining an object
our sensuous and empirical intuition can alone give them significance and meaning
if then we suppose an object of a nonsensuous intuition to be given we can in that case represent it by all those predicates which are implied in the presupposition that nothing appertaining to sensuous intuition belongs to it for example that it is not extended or in space that its duration is not time that in it no change the effect of the determinations in time is to be met with and so on
but it is no proper knowledge if i merely indicate what the intuition of the object is not without being able to say what is contained in it for i have not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure conception of understanding could be applicable because i have not been able to furnish any intuition corresponding to it but am only able to say that our intuition is not valid for it
but the most important point is this that to a something of this kind not one category can be found applicable
take for example the conception of substance that is something that can exist as subject but never as mere predicate in regard to this conception i am quite ignorant whether there can really be anything to correspond to such a determination of thought if empirical intuition did not afford me the occasion for its application
but of this more in the sequel
of the application of the categories to objects of the senses in general
the pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition in general through the understanding alone whether the intuition be our own or some other provided only it be sensuous but are for this very reason mere forms of thought by means of which alone no determined object can be cognized
the synthesis or conjunction of the manifold in these conceptions relates we have said only to the unity of apperception and is for this reason the ground of the possibility of priori cognition in so far as this cognition is dependent on the understanding
this synthesis is therefore not merely transcendental but also purely intellectual
but because a certain form of sensuous intuition exists in the mind priori which rests on the receptivity of the representative faculty sensibility the understanding as a spontaneity is able to determine the internal sense by means of the diversity of given representations conformably to the synthetical unity of apperception and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition priori as the condition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of human intuition
and in this manner the categories as mere forms of thought receive objective reality that is application to objects which are given to us in intuition but that only as phenomena for it is only of phenomena that we are capable of priori intuition
this synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition which is possible and necessary priori may be called figurative synthesis speciosa in contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category in regard to the manifold of an intuition in general and is called connection or conjunction of the understanding synthesis intellectualis
both are transcendental not merely because they themselves precede priori all experience but also because they form the basis for the possibility of other cognition priori
but the figurative synthesis when it has relation only to the originally synthetical unity of apperception that is to the transcendental unity cogitated in the categories must to be distinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction be entitled the transcendental synthesis of imagination
imagination is the faculty of representing an object even without its presence in intuition
now as all our intuition is sensuous imagination by reason of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the conceptions of the understanding belongs to sensibility
but in so far as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity which is determinative and not like sense merely determinable and which is consequently able to determine sense priori according to its form conformably to the unity of apperception in so far is the imagination a faculty of determining sensibility priori and its synthesis of intuitions according to the categories must be the transcendental synthesis of the imagination
it is an operation of the understanding on sensibility and the first application of the understanding to objects of possible intuition and at the same time the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty
as figurative it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis which is produced by the understanding alone without the aid of imagination
now in so far as imagination is spontaneity i sometimes call it also the productive imagination and distinguish it from the reproductive the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical laws those of association namely and which therefore contributes nothing to the explanation of the possibility of priori cognition and for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy but to psychology
we have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox which must have struck every one in our exposition of the internal sense namelyhow this sense represents us to our own consciousness only as we appear to ourselves not as we are in ourselves because to wit we intuite ourselves only as we are inwardly affected
now this appears to be contradictory inasmuch as we thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves and therefore in the systems of psychology the internal sense is commonly held to be one with the faculty of apperception while we on the contrary carefully distinguish them
that which determines the internal sense is the understanding and its original power of conjoining the manifold of intuition that is of bringing this under an apperception upon which rests the possibility of the understanding itself
now as the human understanding is not in itself a faculty of intuition and is unable to exercise such a power in order to conjoin as it were the manifold of its own intuition the synthesis of understanding is considered per se nothing but the unity of action of which as such it is selfconscious even apart from sensibility by which moreover it is able to determine our internal sense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it according to the form of sensuous intuition
thus under the name of a transcendental synthesis of imagination the understanding exercises an activity upon the passive subject whose faculty it is and so we are right in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby
apperception and its synthetical unity are by no means one and the same with the internal sense
the former as the source of all our synthetical conjunction applies under the name of the categories to the manifold of intuition in general prior to all sensuous intuition of objects
the internal sense on the contrary contains merely the form of intuition but without any synthetical conjunction of the manifold therein and consequently does not contain any determined intuition which is possible only through consciousness of the determination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the imagination synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal sense which i have named figurative synthesis
this we can indeed always perceive in ourselves
we cannot cogitate a geometrical line without drawing it in thought nor a circle without describing it nor represent the three dimensions of space without drawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another
we cannot even cogitate time unless in drawing a straight line which is to serve as the external figurative representation of time we fix our attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold whereby we determine successively the internal sense and thus attend also to the succession of this determination
motion as an act of the subject not as a determination of an object consequently the synthesis of the manifold in space if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to the act by which we determine the internal sense according to its form is that which produces the conception of succession
the understanding therefore does by no means find in the internal sense any such synthesis of the manifold but produces it in that it affects this sense
at the same time how i who think is distinct from the i which intuites itself other modes of intuition being cogitable as at least possible and yet one and the same with this latter as the same subject how therefore i am able to say i as an intelligence and thinking subject cognize myself as an object thought so far as i am moreover given to myself in intuitiononly like other phenomena not as i am in myself and as considered by the understanding but merely as i appearis a question that has in it neither more nor less difficulty than the questionhow can i be an object to myself or thishow i can be an object of my own intuition and internal perceptions but that such must be the fact if we admit that space is merely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense can be clearly proved by the consideration that we cannot represent time which is not an object of external intuition in any other way than under the image of a line which we draw in thought a mode of representation without which we could not cognize the unity of its dimension and also that we are necessitated to take our determination of periods of time or of points of time for all our internal perceptions from the changes which we perceive in outward things
it follows that we must arrange the determinations of the internal sense as phenomena in time exactly in the same manner as we arrange those of the external senses in space
and consequently if we grant respecting this latter that by means of them we know objects only in so far as we are affected externally we must also confess with regard to the internal sense that by means of it we intuite ourselves only as we are internally affected by ourselves in other words as regards internal intuition we cognize our own subject only as phenomenon and not as it is in itself
motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science consequently not to geometry because that a thing is movable cannot be known priori but only from experience
but motion considered as the description of a space is a pure act of the successive synthesis of the manifold in external intuition by means of productive imagination and belongs not only to geometry but even to transcendental philosophy
i do not see why so much difficulty should be found in admitting that our internal sense is affected by ourselves
every act of attention exemplifies it
in such an act the understanding determines the internal sense by the synthetical conjunction which it cogitates conformably to the internal intuition which corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the understanding
how much the mind is usually affected thereby every one will be able to perceive in himself
on the other hand in the transcendental synthesis of the manifold content of representations consequently in the synthetical unity of apperception i am conscious of myself not as i appear to myself nor as i am in myself but only that i am
this representation is a thought not an intuition
now as in order to cognize ourselves in addition to the act of thinking which subjects the manifold of every possible intuition to the unity of apperception there is necessary a determinate mode of intuition whereby this manifold is given although my own existence is certainly not mere phenomenon much less mere illusion the determination of my existence can only take place conformably to the form of the internal sense according to the particular mode in which the manifold which i conjoin is given in internal intuition and i have therefore no knowledge of myself as i am but merely as i appear to myself
the consciousness of self is thus very far from a knowledge of self in which i do not use the categories whereby i cogitate an object by means of the conjunction of the manifold in one apperception
in the same way as i require for the sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself not only the thought of an object in general in the category but also an intuition by which to determine that general conception in the same way do i require in order to the cognition of myself not only the consciousness of myself or the thought that i think myself but in addition an intuition of the manifold in myself by which to determine this thought
it is true that i exist as an intelligence which is conscious only of its faculty of conjunction or synthesis but subjected in relation to the manifold which this intelligence has to conjoin to a limitative conjunction called the internal sense
my intelligence that is i can render that conjunction or synthesis perceptible only according to the relations of time which are quite beyond the proper sphere of the conceptions of the understanding and consequently cognize itself in respect to an intuition which cannot possibly be intellectual nor given by the understanding only as it appears to itself and not as it would cognize itself if its intuition were intellectual
the i think expresses the act of determining my own existence
my existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness but the mode in which i must determine my existence that is the mode in which i must place the manifold belonging to my existence is not thereby given
for this purpose intuition of self is required and this intuition possesses a form given priori namely time which is sensuous and belongs to our receptivity of the determinable
now as i do not possess another intuition of self which gives the determining in me of the spontaneity of which i am conscious prior to the act of determination in the same manner as time gives the determinable it is clear that i am unable to determine my own existence as that of a spontaneous being but i am only able to represent to myself the spontaneity of my thought that is of my determination and my existence remains ever determinable in a purely sensuous manner that is to say like the existence of a phenomenon
but it is because of this spontaneity that i call myself an intelligence
transcendental deduction of the universally possible employment in experience of the pure conceptions of the understanding
in the metaphysical deduction the priori origin of categories was proved by their complete accordance with the general logical of thought in the transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibility of the categories as priori cognitions of objects of an intuition in general and
at present we are about to explain the possibility of cognizing priori by means of the categories all objects which can possibly be presented to our senses not indeed according to the form of their intuition but according to the laws of their conjunction or synthesis and thus as it were of prescribing laws to nature and even of rendering nature possible
for if the categories were inadequate to this task it would not be evident to us why everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to those laws which have an priori origin in the understanding itself
i premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension i understand the combination of the manifold in an empirical intuition whereby perception that is empirical consciousness of the intuition as phenomenon is possible
we have priori forms of the external and internal sensuous intuition in the representations of space and time and to these must the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always comformable because the synthesis itself can only take place according to these forms
but space and time are not merely forms of sensuous intuition but intuitions themselves which contain a manifold and therefore contain priori the determination of the unity of this manifold
see the transcendent sthetic
therefore is unity of the synthesis of the manifold without or within us consequently also a conjunction to which all that is to be represented as determined in space or time must correspond given priori along with not in these intuitions as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of them
but this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the conjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general in a primitive act of consciousness according to the categories but applied to our sensuous intuition
consequently all synthesis whereby alone is even perception possible is subject to the categories
and as experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions the categories are conditions of the possibility of experience and are therefore valid priori for all objects of experience
space represented as an object as geometry really requires it to be contains more than the mere form of the intuition namely a combination of the manifold given according to the form of sensibility into a representation that can be intuited so that the form of the intuition gives us merely the manifold but the formal intuition gives unity of representation
in the sthetic i regarded this unity as belonging entirely to sensibility for the purpose of indicating that it antecedes all conceptions although it presupposes a synthesis which does not belong to sense through which alone however all our conceptions of space and time are possible
for as by means of this unity alone the understanding determining the sensibility space and time are given as intuitions it follows that the unity of this intuition priori belongs to space and time and not to the conception of the understanding
when then for example i make the empirical intuition of a house by apprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception the necessary unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lies at the foundation of this act and i as it were draw the form of the house conformably to this synthetical unity of the manifold in space
but this very synthetical unity remains even when i abstract the form of space and has its seat in the understanding and is in fact the category of the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition that is to say the category of quantity to which the aforesaid synthesis of apprehension that is the perception must be completely conformable
in this manner it is proved that the synthesis of apprehension which is empirical must necessarily be conformable to the synthesis of apperception which is intellectual and contained priori in the category
it is one and the same spontaneity which at one time under the name of imagination at another under that of understanding produces conjunction in the manifold of intuition
to take another example when i perceive the freezing of water i apprehend two states fluidity and solidity which as such stand toward each other mutually in a relation of time
but in the time which i place as an internal intuition at the foundation of this phenomenon i represent to myself synthetical unity of the manifold without which the aforesaid relation could not be given in an intuition as determined in regard to the succession of time
now this synthetical unity as the priori condition under which i conjoin the manifold of an intuition is if i make abstraction of the permanent form of my internal intuition that is to say of time the category of cause by means of which when applied to my sensibility i determine everything that occurs according to relations of time
consequently apprehension in such an event and the event itself as far as regards the possibility of its perception stands under the conception of the relation of cause and effect and so in all other cases
categories are conceptions which prescribe laws priori to phenomena consequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena natura materialiter spectata
and now the question arisesinasmuch as these categories are not derived from nature and do not regulate themselves according to her as their model for in that case they would be empiricalhow it is conceivable that nature must regulate herself according to them in other words how the categories can determine priori the synthesis of the manifold of nature and yet not derive their origin from her
the following is the solution of this enigma
it is not in the least more difficult to conceive how the laws of the phenomena of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with its priori formthat is its faculty of conjoining the manifoldthan it is to understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with the priori form of our sensuous intuition
for laws do not exist in the phenomena any more than the phenomena exist as things in themselves
laws do not exist except by relation to the subject in which the phenomena inhere in so far as it possesses understanding just as phenomena have no existence except by relation to the same existing subject in so far as it has senses
to things as things in themselves conformability to law must necessarily belong independently of an understanding to cognize them
but phenomena are only representations of things which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are in themselves
but as mere representations they stand under no law of conjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes
now that which conjoins the manifold of sensuous intuition is imagination a mental act to which understanding contributes unity of intellectual synthesis and sensibility manifoldness of apprehension
now as all possible perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension and this empirical synthesis itself on the transcendental consequently on the categories it is evident that all possible perceptions and therefore everything that can attain to empirical consciousness that is all phenomena of nature must as regards their conjunction be subject to the categories
and nature considered merely as nature in general is dependent on them as the original ground of her necessary conformability to law as natura formaliter spectata
but the pure faculty of the understanding of prescribing laws priori to phenomena by means of mere categories is not competent to enounce other or more laws than those on which a nature in general as a conformability to law of phenomena of space and time depends
particular laws inasmuch as they concern empirically determined phenomena cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws although they all stand under them
experience must be superadded in order to know these particular laws but in regard to experience in general and everything that can be cognized as an object thereof these priori laws are our only rule and guide
result of this deduction of the conceptions of the understanding
we cannot think any object except by means of the categories we cannot cognize any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to these conceptions
now all our intuitions are sensuous and our cognition in so far as the object of it is given is empirical
but empirical cognition is experience consequently no priori cognition is possible for us except of objects of possible experience
lest my readers should stumble at this assertion and the conclusions that may be too rashly drawn from it i must remind them that the categories in the act of thought are by no means limited by the conditions of our sensuous intuition but have an unbounded sphere of action
it is only the cognition of the object of thought the determining of the object which requires intuition
in the absence of intuition our thought of an object may still have true and useful consequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject
but as this exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination of the object in other words on cognition thereof but also on the determination of the subject and its volition i do not intend to treat of it in this place
but this cognition which is limited to objects of experience is not for that reason derived entirely from experience butand this is asserted of the pure intuitions and the pure conceptions of the understandingthere are unquestionably elements of cognition which exist in the mind priori
now there are only two ways in which a necessary harmony of experience with the conceptions of its objects can be cogitated
either experience makes these conceptions possible or the conceptions make experience possible
the former of these statements will not hold good with respect to the categories nor in regard to pure sensuous intuition for they are priori conceptions and therefore independent of experience
the assertion of an empirical origin would attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca
consequently nothing remains but to adopt the second alternative which presents us with a system as it were of the epigenesis of pure reason namely that on the part of the understanding the categories do contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience
but with respect to the questions how they make experience possible and what are the principles of the possibility thereof with which they present us in their application to phenomena the following section on the transcendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform the reader
it is quite possible that someone may propose a species of preformationsystem of pure reasona middle way between the twoto wit that the categories are neither innate and first priori principles of cognition nor derived from experience but are merely subjective aptitudes for thought implanted in us contemporaneously with our existence which were so ordered and disposed by our creator that their exercise perfectly harmonizes with the laws of nature which regulate experience
now not to mention that with such an hypothesis it is impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment of predetermined aptitudes the fact that the categories would in this case entirely lose that character of necessity which is essentially involved in the very conception of them is a conclusive objection to it
the conception of cause for example which expresses the necessity of an effect under a presupposed condition would be false if it rested only upon such an arbitrary subjective necessity of uniting certain empirical representations according to such a rule of relation
i could not then saythe effect is connected with its cause in the object that is necessarily but only i am so constituted that i can think this representation as so connected and not otherwise
now this is just what the sceptic wants
for in this case all our knowledge depending on the supposed objective validity of our judgement is nothing but mere illusion nor would there be wanting people who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect to themselves though they must feel it
at all events we could not dispute with any one on that which merely depends on the manner in which his subject is organized
short view of the above deduction
the foregoing deduction is an exposition of the pure conceptions of the understanding and with them of all theoretical priori cognition as principles of the possibility of experience but of experience as the determination of all phenomena in space and time in generalof experience finally from the principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception as the form of the understanding in relation to time and space as original forms of sensibility
i consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to this point because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions
as we now proceed to the exposition of the employment of these i shall not designate the chapters in this manner any further
book ii
analytic of principles
general logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly with the division of the higher faculties of cognition
these are understanding judgement and reason
this science accordingly treats in its analytic of conceptions judgements and conclusions in exact correspondence with the functions and order of those mental powers which we include generally under the generic denomination of understanding
as this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content of cognition whether pure or empirical and occupies itself with the mere form of thought discursive cognition it must contain in its analytic a canon for reason
for the form of reason has its law which without taking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about which it is employed can be discovered priori by the simple analysis of the action of reason into its momenta
transcendental logic limited as it is to a determinate content that of pure priori cognitions to wit cannot imitate general logic in this division
for it is evident that the transcendental employment of reason is not objectively valid and therefore does not belong to the logic of truth that is to analytic but as a logic of illusion occupies a particular department in the scholastic system under the name of transcendental dialectic
understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic a canon of objectively valid and therefore true exercise and are comprehended in the analytical department of that logic
but reason in her endeavours to arrive by priori means at some true statement concerning objects and to extend cognition beyond the bounds of possible experience is altogether dialectic and her illusory assertions cannot be constructed into a canon such as an analytic ought to contain
accordingly the analytic of principles will be merely a canon for the faculty of judgement for the instruction of this faculty in its application to phenomena of the pure conceptions of the understanding which contain the necessary condition for the establishment of priori laws
on this account although the subject of the following chapters is the especial principles of understanding i shall make use of the term doctrine of the faculty of judgement in order to define more particularly my present purpose
introduction
of the transcendental faculty of judgement in general
if understanding in general be defined as the faculty of laws or rules the faculty of judgement may be termed the faculty of subsumption under these rules that is of distinguishing whether this or that does or does not stand under a given rule casus datae legis
general logic contains no directions or precepts for the faculty of judgement nor can it contain any such
for as it makes abstraction of all content of cognition no duty is left for it except that of exposing analytically the mere form of cognition in conceptions judgements and conclusions and of thereby establishing formal rules for all exercise of the understanding
now if this logic wished to give some general direction how we should subsume under these rules that is how we should distinguish whether this or that did or did not stand under them this again could not be done otherwise than by means of a rule
but this rule precisely because it is a rule requires for itself direction from the faculty of judgement
thus it is evident that the understanding is capable of being instructed by rules but that the judgement is a peculiar talent which does not and cannot require tuition but only exercise
this faculty is therefore the specific quality of the socalled mother wit the want of which no scholastic discipline can compensate
for although education may furnish and as it were engraft upon a limited understanding rules borrowed from other minds yet the power of employing these rules correctly must belong to the pupil himself and no rule which we can prescribe to him with this purpose is in the absence or deficiency of this gift of nature secure from misuse
a physician therefore a judge or a statesman may have in his head many admirable pathological juridical or political rules in a degree that may enable him to be a profound teacher in his particular science and yet in the application of these rules he may very possibly blundereither because he is wanting in natural judgement though not in understanding and whilst he can comprehend the general in abstracto cannot distinguish whether a particular case in concreto ought to rank under the former or because his faculty of judgement has not been sufficiently exercised by examples and real practice
indeed the grand and only use of examples is to sharpen the judgement
for as regards the correctness and precision of the insight of the understanding examples are commonly injurious rather than otherwise because as casus in terminis they seldom adequately fulfil the conditions of the rule
besides they often weaken the power of our understanding to apprehend rules or laws in their universality independently of particular circumstances of experience and hence accustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles
examples are thus the gocart of the judgement which he who is naturally deficient in that faculty cannot afford to dispense with
deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called stupidity and for such a failing we know no remedy
a dull or narrowminded person to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding may be improved by tuition even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned
but as such persons frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement it is not uncommon to find men extremely learned who in the application of their science betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want
but although general logic cannot give directions to the faculty of judgement the case is very different as regards transcendental logic insomuch that it appears to be the especial duty of the latter to secure and direct by means of determinate rules the faculty of judgement in the employment of the pure understanding
for as a doctrine that is as an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of the understanding in regard to pure priori cognitions philosophy is worse than useless since from all the attempts hitherto made little or no ground has been gained
but as a critique in order to guard against the mistakes of the faculty of judgement lapsus judicii in the employment of the few pure conceptions of the understanding which we possess although its use is in this case purely negative philosophy is called upon to apply all its acuteness and penetration
but transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity that besides indicating the rule or rather the general condition for rules which is given in the pure conception of the understanding it can at the same time indicate priori the case to which the rule must be applied
the cause of the superiority which in this respect transcendental philosophy possesses above all other sciences except mathematics lies in this it treats of conceptions which must relate priori to their objects whose objective validity consequently cannot be demonstrated posteriori and is at the same time under the obligation of presenting in general but sufficient tests the conditions under which objects can be given in harmony with those conceptions otherwise they would be mere logical forms without content and not pure conceptions of the understanding
our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will contain two chapters
the first will treat of the sensuous condition under which alone pure conceptions of the understanding can be employedthat is of the schematism of the pure understanding
the second will treat of those synthetical judgements which are derived priori from pure conceptions of the understanding under those conditions and which lie priori at the foundation of all other cognitions that is to say it will treat of the principles of the pure understanding
transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement or analytic of principles
chapter i
of the schematism at of the pure conceptions of the understanding
in all subsumptions of an object under a conception the representation of the object must be homogeneous with the conception in other words the conception must contain that which is represented in the object to be subsumed under it
for this is the meaning of the expression an object is contained under a conception
thus the empirical conception of a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of a circle inasmuch as the roundness which is cogitated in the former is intuited in the latter
but pure conceptions of the understanding when compared with empirical intuitions or even with sensuous intuitions in general are quite heterogeneous and never can be discovered in any intuition
how then is the subsumption of the latter under the former and consequently the application of the categories to phenomena possiblefor it is impossible to say for example causality can be intuited through the senses and is contained in the phenomenon
this natural and important question forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement with the purpose to wit of showing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to phenomena
in all other sciences where the conceptions by which the object is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneous from those which represent the object in concretoas it is given it is quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning the application of the former to the latter
now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing which on the one side is homogeneous with the category and with the phenomenon on the other and so makes the application of the former to the latter possible
this mediating representation must be pure without any empirical content and yet must on the one side be intellectual on the other sensuous
such a representation is the transcendental schema
the conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of the manifold in general
time as the formal condition of the manifold of the internal sense consequently of the conjunction of all representations contains priori a manifold in the pure intuition
now a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with the category which constitutes the unity thereof that it is universal and rests upon a rule priori
on the other hand it is so far homogeneous with the phenomenon inasmuch as time is contained in every empirical representation of the manifold
thus an application of the category to phenomena becomes possible by means of the transcendental determination of time which as the schema of the conceptions of the understanding mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former
after what has been proved in our deduction of the categories no one it is to be hoped can hesitate as to the proper decision of the question whether the employment of these pure conceptions of the understanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental in other words whether the categories as conditions of a possible experience relate priori solely to phenomena or whether as conditions of the possibility of things in general their application can be extended to objects as things in themselves
for we have there seen that conceptions are quite impossible and utterly without signification unless either to them or at least to the elements of which they consist an object be given and that consequently they cannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regard to the question whether and how these may be given to us and further that the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means of the modification of our sensibility and finally that pure priori conceptions in addition to the function of the understanding in the category must contain priori formal conditions of sensibility of the internal sense namely which again contain the general condition under which alone the category can be applied to any object
this formal and pure condition of sensibility to which the conception of the understanding is restricted in its employment we shall name the schema of the conception of the understanding and the procedure of the understanding with these schemata we shall call the schematism of the pure understanding
the schema is in itself always a mere product of the imagination
but as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single intuition but merely unity in the determination of sensibility the schema is clearly distinguishable from the image
thus if i place five points one after another
this is an image of the number five
on the other hand if i only think a number in general which may be either five or a hundred this thought is rather the representation of a method of representing in an image a sum e
g
a thousand in conformity with a conception than the image itself an image which i should find some little difficulty in reviewing and comparing with the conception
now this representation of a general procedure of the imagination to present its image to a conception i call the schema of this conception
in truth it is not images of objects but schemata which lie at the foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions
no image could ever be adequate to our conception of a triangle in general
for the generalness of the conception it never could attain to as this includes under itself all triangles whether rightangled acuteangled etc
whilst the image would always be limited to a single part of this sphere
the schema of the triangle can exist nowhere else than in thought and it indicates a rule of the synthesis of the imagination in regard to pure figures in space
still less is an object of experience or an image of the object ever to the empirical conception
on the contrary the conception always relates immediately to the schema of the imagination as a rule for the determination of our intuition in conformity with a certain general conception
the conception of a dog indicates a rule according to which my imagination can delineate the figure of a fourfooted animal in general without being limited to any particular individual form which experience presents to me or indeed to any possible image that i can represent to myself in concreto
this schematism of our understanding in regard to phenomena and their mere form is an art hidden in the depths of the human soul whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty discover and unveil
thus much only can we say the image is a product of the empirical faculty of the productive imaginationthe schema of sensuous conceptions of figures in space for example is a product and as it were a monogram of the pure imagination priori whereby and according to which images first become possible which however can be connected with the conception only mediately by means of the schema which they indicate and are in themselves never fully adequate to it
on the other hand the schema of a pure conception of the understanding is something that cannot be reduced into any imageit is nothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by the category conformably to a rule of unity according to conceptions
it is a transcendental product of the imagination a product which concerns the determination of the internal sense according to conditions of its form time in respect to all representations in so far as these representations must be conjoined priori in one conception conformably to the unity of apperception
without entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential requisites of transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanation of them according to the order of the categories and in connection therewith
for the external sense the pure image of all quantities quantorum is space the pure image of all objects of sense in general is time
but the pure schema of quantity quantitatis as a conception of the understanding is number a representation which comprehends the successive addition of one to one homogeneous quantities
thus number is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold in a homogeneous intuition by means of my generating time itself in my apprehension of the intuition
reality in the pure conception of the understanding is that which corresponds to a sensation in general that consequently the conception of which indicates a being in time
negation is that the conception of which represents a notbeing in time
the opposition of these two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same time as a time filled or a time empty
now as time is only the form of intuition consequently of objects as phenomena that which in objects corresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects as things in themselves sachheit reality
now every sensation has a degree or quantity by which it can fill time that is to say the internal sense in respect of the representation of an object more or less until it vanishes into nothing negatio
thus there is a relation and connection between reality and negation or rather a transition from the former to the latter which makes every reality representable to us as a quantum and the schema of a reality as the quantity of something in so far as it fills time is exactly this continuous and uniform generation of the reality in time as we descend in time from the sensation which has a certain degree down to the vanishing thereof or gradually ascend from negation to the quantity thereof
the schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time that is the representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination of time a substratum which therefore remains whilst all else changes
time passes not but in it passes the existence of the changeable
to time therefore which is itself unchangeable and permanent corresponds that which in the phenomenon is unchangeable in existence that is substance and it is only by it that the succession and coexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time
the schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which when posited is always followed by something else
it consists therefore in the succession of the manifold in so far as that succession is subjected to a rule
the schema of community reciprocity of action and reaction or the reciprocal causality of substances in respect of their accidents is the coexistence of the determinations of the one with those of the other according to a general rule
the schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis of different representations with the conditions of time in general as for example opposites cannot exist together at the same time in the same thing but only after each other and is therefore the determination of the representation of a thing at any time
the schema of reality is existence in a determined time
the schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time
it is clear from all this that the schema of the category of quantity contains and represents the generation synthesis of time itself in the successive apprehension of an object the schema of quality the synthesis of sensation with the representation of time or the filling up of time the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each other in all time that is according to a rule of the determination of time and finally the schema of modality and its categories time itself as the correlative of the determination of an objectwhether it does belong to time and how
the schemata therefore are nothing but priori determinations of time according to rules and these in regard to all possible objects following the arrangement of the categories relate to the series in time the content in time the order in time and finally to the complex or totality in time
hence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding by means of the transcendental synthesis of the imagination amounts to nothing else than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense and thus indirectly to the unity of apperception as a function corresponding to the internal sense a receptivity
thus the schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and only conditions whereby our understanding receives an application to objects and consequently significance
finally therefore the categories are only capable of empirical use inasmuch as they serve merely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis by means of an priori necessary unity on account of the necessary union of all consciousness in one original apperception and so to render them susceptible of a complete connection in one experience
but within this whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions and in the universal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth which antecedes all empirical truth and renders the latter possible
it is however evident at first sight that although the schemata of sensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories they do nevertheless also restrict them that is they limit the categories by conditions which lie beyond the sphere of understandingnamely in sensibility
hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon or the sensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category
numerus est quantitas phaenomenonsensatio realitas phaenomenon constans et perdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenonaeternitas necessitas phaenomena etc
now if we remove a restrictive condition we thereby amplify it appears the formerly limited conception
in this way the categories in their pure signification free from all conditions of sensibility ought to be valid of things as they are and not as the schemata represent them merely as they appear and consequently the categories must have a significance far more extended and wholly independent of all schemata
in truth there does always remain to the pure conceptions of the understanding after abstracting every sensuous condition a value and significance which is however merely logical
but in this case no object is given them and therefore they have no meaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object
the notion of substance for example if we leave out the sensuous determination of permanence would mean nothing more than a something which can be cogitated as subject without the possibility of becoming a predicate to anything else
of this representation i can make nothing inasmuch as it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesses which must thus be valid as premier subject
consequently the categories without schemata are merely functions of the understanding for the production of conceptions but do not represent any object
this significance they derive from sensibility which at the same time realizes the understanding and restricts it
chapter ii
system of all principles of the pure understanding
in the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general conditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is justified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding for synthetical judgements
our duty at present is to exhibit in systematic connection those judgements which the understanding really produces priori
for this purpose our table of the categories will certainly afford us the natural and safe guidance
for it is precisely the categories whose application to possible experience must constitute all pure priori cognition of the understanding and the relation of which to sensibility will on that very account present us with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of the use of the understanding
principles priori are so called not merely because they contain in themselves the grounds of other judgements but also because they themselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions
this peculiarity however does not raise them altogether above the need of a proof
for although there could be found no higher cognition and therefore no objective proof and although such a principle rather serves as the foundation for all cognition of the object this by no means hinders us from drawing a proof from the subjective sources of the possibility of the cognition of an object
such a proof is necessary moreover because without it the principle might be liable to the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion
in the second place we shall limit our investigations to those principles which relate to the categories
for as to the principles of transcendental sthetic according to which space and time are the conditions of the possibility of things as phenomena as also the restriction of these principles namely that they cannot be applied to objects as things in themselvesthese of course do not fall within the scope of our present inquiry
in like manner the principles of mathematical science form no part of this system because they are all drawn from intuition and not from the pure conception of the understanding
the possibility of these principles however will necessarily be considered here inasmuch as they are synthetical judgements priori not indeed for the purpose of proving their accuracy and apodeictic certainty which is unnecessary but merely to render conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident priori cognitions
but we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical judgements in opposition to synthetical judgements which is the proper subject of our inquiries because this very opposition will free the theory of the latter from all ambiguity and place it clearly before our eyes in its true nature
system of the principles of the pure understanding
section i
of the supreme principle of all analytical judgements
whatever may be the content of our cognition and in whatever manner our cognition may be related to its object the universal although only negative conditions of all our judgements is that they do not contradict themselves otherwise these judgements are in themselves even without respect to the object nothing
but although there may exist no contradiction in our judgement it may nevertheless connect conceptions in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object or without any grounds either priori or posteriori for arriving at such a judgement and thus without being selfcontradictory a judgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless
now the proposition no subject can have a predicate that contradicts it is called the principle of contradiction and is a universal but purely negative criterion of all truth
but it belongs to logic alone because it is valid of cognitions merely as cognitions and without respect to their content and declares that the contradiction entirely nullifies them
we can also however make a positive use of this principle that is not merely to banish falsehood and error in so far as it rests upon contradiction but also for the cognition of truth
for if the judgement is analytical be it affirmative or negative its truth must always be recognizable by means of the principle of contradiction
for the contrary of that which lies and is cogitated as conception in the cognition of the object will be always properly negatived but the conception itself must always be affirmed of the object inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to the object
we must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the universal and fully sufficient principle of all analytical cognition
but as a sufficient criterion of truth it has no further utility or authority
for the fact that no cognition can be at variance with this principle without nullifying itself constitutes this principle the sine qua non but not the determining ground of the truth of our cognition
as our business at present is properly with the synthetical part of our knowledge only we shall always be on our guard not to transgress this inviolable principle but at the same time not to expect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth of any synthetical proposition
there exists however a formula of this celebrated principlea principle merely formal and entirely without contentwhich contains a synthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up with it
it is this it is impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time
not to mention the superfluousness of the addition of the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty which ought to be selfevident from the proposition itself the proposition is affected by the condition of time and as it were says a thing a which is something b cannot at the same time be nonb
but both b as well as nonb may quite well exist in succession
for example a man who is young cannot at the same time be old but the same man can very well be at one time young and at another not young that is old
now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must not by any means limit its application merely to relations of time and consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true purpose
the misunderstanding arises in this way
we first of all separate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing and afterwards connect with this predicate its opposite and hence do not establish any contradiction with the subject but only with its predicate which has been conjoined with the subject syntheticallya contradiction moreover which obtains only when the first and second predicate are affirmed in the same time
if i say a man who is ignorant is not learned the condition at the same time must be added for he who is at one time ignorant may at another be learned
but if i say no ignorant man is a learned man the proposition is analytical because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent part of the conception of the subject and in this case the negative proposition is evident immediately from the proposition of contradiction without the necessity of adding the condition the same time
this is the reason why i have altered the formula of this principlean alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an analytical proposition
section ii
of the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements
the explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task with which general logic has nothing to do indeed she needs not even be acquainted with its name
but in transcendental logic it is the most important matter to be dealt withindeed the only one if the question is of the possibility of synthetical judgements priori the conditions and extent of their validity
for when this question is fully decided it can reach its aim with perfect ease the determination to wit of the extent and limits of the pure understanding
in an analytical judgement i do not go beyond the given conception in order to arrive at some decision respecting it
if the judgement is affirmative i predicate of the conception only that which was already cogitated in it if negative i merely exclude from the conception its contrary
but in synthetical judgements i must go beyond the given conception in order to cogitate in relation with it something quite different from that which was cogitated in it a relation which is consequently never one either of identity or contradiction and by means of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot be discerned merely from the judgement itself
granted then that we must go out beyond a given conception in order to compare it synthetically with another a third thing is necessary in which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate
now what is this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical judgements it is only a complex in which all our representations are contained the internal sense to wit and its form priori time
the synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination their synthetical unity which is requisite to a judgement upon the unity of apperception
in this therefore is to be sought the possibility of synthetical judgements and as all three contain the sources of priori representations the possibility of pure synthetical judgements also nay they are necessary upon these grounds if we are to possess a knowledge of objects which rests solely upon the synthesis of representations
if a cognition is to have objective reality that is to relate to an object and possess sense and meaning in respect to it it is necessary that the object be given in some way or another
without this our conceptions are empty and we may indeed have thought by means of them but by such thinking we have not in fact cognized anything we have merely played with representation
to give an object if this expression be understood in the sense of to present the object not mediately but immediately in intuition means nothing else than to apply the representation of it to experience be that experience real or only possible
space and time themselves pure as these conceptions are from all that is empirical and certain as it is that they are represented fully priori in the mind would be completely without objective validity and without sense and significance if their necessary use in the objects of experience were not shown
nay the representation of them is a mere schema that always relates to the reproductive imagination which calls up the objects of experience without which they have no meaning
and so it is with all conceptions without distinction
the possibility of experience is then that which gives objective reality to all our priori cognitions
now experience depends upon the synthetical unity of phenomena that is upon a synthesis according to conceptions of the object of phenomena in general a synthesis without which experience never could become knowledge but would be merely a rhapsody of perceptions never fitting together into any connected text according to rules of a thoroughly united possible consciousness and therefore never subjected to the transcendental and necessary unity of apperception
experience has therefore for a foundation priori principles of its form that is to say general rules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena the objective reality of which rules as necessary conditions even of the possibility of experience can which rules as necessary conditionseven of the possibility of experiencecan always be shown in experience
but apart from this relation priori synthetical propositions are absolutely impossible because they have no third term that is no pure object in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of its conceptions
although then respecting space or the forms which productive imagination describes therein we do cognize much priori in synthetical judgements and are really in no need of experience for this purpose such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but a busy trifling with a mere chimera were not space to be considered as the condition of the phenomena which constitute the material of external experience
hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate though but mediately to possible experience or rather to the possibility of experience and upon that alone is founded the objective validity of their synthesis
while then on the one hand experience as empirical synthesis is the only possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all other synthesis on the other hand this latter synthesis as cognition priori possesses truth that is accordance with its object only in so far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary to the synthetical unity of experience
accordingly the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is every object is subject to the necessary conditions of the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience
priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formal conditions of the priori intuition the synthesis of the imagination and the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental apperception to a possible cognition of experience and say the conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience and have for that reason objective validity in an priori synthetical judgement
section iii
systematic representation of all synthetical principles of the pure understanding
that principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pure understanding which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to that which happens but is even the source of principles according to which everything that can be presented to us as an object is necessarily subject to rules because without such rules we never could attain to cognition of an object
even the laws of nature if they are contemplated as principles of the empirical use of the understanding possess also a characteristic of necessity and we may therefore at least expect them to be determined upon grounds which are valid priori and antecedent to all experience
but all laws of nature without distinction are subject to higher principles of the understanding inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the latter to particular cases of experience
these higher principles alone therefore give the conception which contains the necessary condition and as it were the exponent of a rule experience on the other hand gives the case which comes under the rule
there is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles for principles of the pure understanding or conversely for the character of necessity according to conceptions which distinguish the latter and the absence of this in every empirical proposition how extensively valid soever it may be is a perfect safeguard against confounding them
there are however pure principles priori which nevertheless i should not ascribe to the pure understandingfor this reason that they are not derived from pure conceptions but although by the mediation of the understanding from pure intuitions
but understanding is the faculty of conceptions
such principles mathematical science possesses but their application to experience consequently their objective validity nay the possibility of such priori synthetical cognitions the deduction thereof rests entirely upon the pure understanding
on this account i shall not reckon among my principles those of mathematics though i shall include those upon the possibility and objective validity priori of principles of the mathematical science which consequently are to be looked upon as the principle of these and which proceed from conceptions to intuition and not from intuition to conceptions
in the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding to possible experience the employment of their synthesis is either mathematical or dynamical for it is directed partly on the intuition alone partly on the existence of a phenomenon
but the priori conditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experience absolutely necessary those of the existence of objects of a possible empirical intuition are in themselves contingent
hence the principles of the mathematical use of the categories will possess a character of absolute necessity that is will be apodeictic those on the other hand of the dynamical use the character of an priori necessity indeed but only under the condition of empirical thought in an experience therefore only mediately and indirectly
consequently they will not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the former although their application to experience does not for that reason lose its truth and certitude
but of this point we shall be better able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principles
the table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of principles because these are nothing else than rules for the objective employment of the former
accordingly all principles of the pure understanding are
axioms of intuition
anticipations analogies of perception of experience postulates of empirical thought in general
these appellations i have chosen advisedly in order that we might not lose sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and the employment of these principles
it will however soon appear thata fact which concerns both the evidence of these principles and the priori determination of phenomenaaccording to the categories of quantity and quality if we attend merely to the form of these the principles of these categories are distinguishable from those of the two others in as much as the former are possessed of an intuitive but the latter of a merely discursive though in both instances a complete certitude
i shall therefore call the former mathematical and the latter dynamical principles
it must be observed however that by these terms i mean just as little in the one case the principles of mathematics as those of general physical dynamics in the other
i have here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding in their application to the internal sense without distinction of the representations given therein by means of which the sciences of mathematics and dynamics become possible
accordingly i have named these principles rather with reference to their application than their content and i shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which they stand in the table
all combination conjunctio is either composition compositio or connection nexus
the former is the synthesis of a manifold the parts of which do not necessarily belong to each other
for example the two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal do not necessarily belong to each other and of this kind is the synthesis of the homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered
this synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition the former of which is applied to extensive the latter to intensive quantities
the second sort of combination nexus is the synthesis of a manifold in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each other for example the accident to a substance or the effect to the cause
consequently it is a synthesis of that which though heterogeneous is represented as connected priori
this combinationnot an arbitrary onei entitle dynamical because it concerns the connection of the existence of the manifold
this again may be divided into the physical synthesis of the phenomena divided among each other and the metaphysical synthesis or the connection of phenomena priori in the faculty of cognition
axioms of intuition
the principle of these is all intuitions are extensive quantities
proof
all phenomena contain as regards their form an intuition in space and time which lies priori at the foundation of all without exception
phenomena therefore cannot be apprehended that is received into empirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a manifold through which the representations of a determinate space or time are generated that is to say through the composition of the homogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of this manifold homogeneous
now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold in intuition in so far as thereby the representation of an object is rendered possible is the conception of a quantity quanti
consequently even the perception of an object as phenomenon is possible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the given sensuous intuition through which the unity of the composition of the homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated that is to say all phenomena are quantities and extensive quantities because as intuitions in space or time they must be represented by means of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves are determined
an extensive quantity i call that wherein the representation of the parts renders possible and therefore necessarily antecedes the representation of the whole
i cannot represent to myself any line however small without drawing it in thought that is without generating from a point all its parts one after another and in this way alone producing this intuition
precisely the same is the case with every even the smallest portion of time
i cogitate therein only the successive progress from one moment to another and hence by means of the different portions of time and the addition of them a determinate quantity of time is produced
as the pure intuition in all phenomena is either time or space so is every phenomenon in its character of intuition an extensive quantity inasmuch as it can only be cognized in our apprehension by successive synthesis from part to part
all phenomena are accordingly to be considered as aggregates that is as a collection of previously given parts which is not the case with every sort of quantities but only with those which are represented and apprehended by us as extensive
on this successive synthesis of the productive imagination in the generation of figures is founded the mathematics of extension or geometry with its axioms which express the conditions of sensuous intuition priori under which alone the schema of a pure conception of external intuition can exist for example be tween two points only one straight line is possible two straight lines cannot enclose a space etc
these are the axioms which properly relate only to quantities quanta as such
but as regards the quantity of a thing quantitas that is to say the answer to the question how large is this or that object although in respect to this question we have various propositions synthetical and immediately certain indemonstrabilia we have in the proper sense of the term no axioms
for example the propositions if equals be added to equals the wholes are equal if equals be taken from equals the remainders are equal are analytical because i am immediately conscious of the identity of the production of the one quantity with the production of the other whereas axioms must be priori synthetical propositions
on the other hand the selfevident propositions as to the relation of numbers are certainly synthetical but not universal like those of geometry and for this reason cannot be called axioms but numerical formulae
that is not an analytical proposition
for neither in the representation of seven nor of five nor of the composition of the two numbers do i cogitate the number twelve
whether i cogitate the number in the addition of both is not at present the question for in the case of an analytical proposition the only point is whether i really cogitate the predicate in the representation of the subject
but although the proposition is synthetical it is nevertheless only a singular proposition
in so far as regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous the units it cannot take place except in one manner although our use of these numbers is afterwards general
if i say a triangle can be constructed with three lines any two of which taken together are greater than the third i exercise merely the pure function of the productive imagination which may draw the lines longer or shorter and construct the angles at its pleasure
on the contrary the number seven is possible only in one manner and so is likewise the number twelve which results from the synthesis of seven and five
such propositions then cannot be termed axioms for in that case we should have an infinity of these but numerical formulae
this transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly enlarges our priori cognition
for it is by this principle alone that pure mathematics is rendered applicable in all its precision to objects of experience and without it the validity of this application would not be so selfevident on the contrary contradictions and confusions have often arisen on this very point
phenomena are not things in themselves
empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition of space and time consequently what geometry affirms of the latter is indisputably valid of the former
all evasions such as the statement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of construction in space for example to the rule of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles must fall to the ground
for if these objections hold good we deny to space and with it to all mathematics objective validity and no longer know wherefore and how far mathematics can be applied to phenomena
the synthesis of spaces and times as the essential form of all intuition is that which renders possible the apprehension of a phenomenon and therefore every external experience consequently all cognition of the objects of experience and whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former must necessarily hold good of the latter
all objections are but the chicaneries of an illinstructed reason which erroneously thinks to liberate the objects of sense from the formal conditions of our sensibility and represents these although mere phenomena as things in themselves presented as such to our understanding
but in this case no priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the science which determines these conceptions that is to say geometry would itself be impossible
anticipations of perception
the principle of these is in all phenomena the real that which is an object of sensation has intensive quantity that is has a degree
proof
perception is empirical consciousness that is to say a consciousness which contains an element of sensation
phenomena as objects of perception are not pure that is merely formal intuitions like space and time for they cannot be perceived in themselves
they contain then over and above the intuition the materials for an object through which is represented something existing in space or time that is to say they contain the real of sensation as a representation merely subjective which gives us merely the consciousness that the subject is affected and which we refer to some external object
now a gradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness is possible inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirely vanishes and there remains a merely formal consciousness priori of the manifold in time and space consequently there is possible a synthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation from its commencement that is from the pure intuition onwards up to a certain quantity of the sensation
now as sensation in itself is not an objective representation and in it is to be found neither the intuition of space nor of time it cannot possess any extensive quantity and yet there does belong to it a quantity and that by means of its apprehension in which empirical consciousness can within a certain time rise from nothing up to its given amount consequently an intensive quantity
and thus we must ascribe intensive quantity that is a degree of influence on sense to all objects of perception in so far as this perception contains sensation
they can be perceived only as phenomena and some part of them must always belong to the nonego whereas pure intuitions are entirely the products of the mind itself and as such are cognized in themselves
tr
all cognition by means of which i am enabled to cognize and determine priori what belongs to empirical cognition may be called an anticipation and without doubt this is the sense in which epicurus employed his expression prholepsis
but as there is in phenomena something which is never cognized priori which on this account constitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition that is to say sensation as the matter of perception it follows that sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at all anticipated
on the other hand we might very well term the pure determinations in space and time as well in regard to figure as to quantity anticipations of phenomena because they represent priori that which may always be given posteriori in experience
but suppose that in every sensation as sensation in general without any particular sensation being thought of there existed something which could be cognized priori this would deserve to be called anticipation in a special sensespecial because it may seem surprising to forestall experience in that which concerns the matter of experience and which we can only derive from itself
yet such really is the case here
apprehension by means of sensation alone fills only one moment that is if i do not take into consideration a succession of many sensations
as that in the phenomenon the apprehension of which is not a successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entire representation sensation has therefore no extensive quantity the want of sensation in a moment of time would represent it as empty consequently
that which in the empirical intuition corresponds to sensation is reality realitas phaenomenon that which corresponds to the absence of it negation
now every sensation is capable of a diminution so that it can decrease and thus gradually disappear
therefore between reality in a phenomenon and negation there exists a continuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations the difference of which from each other is always smaller than that between the given sensation and zero or complete negation
that is to say the real in a phenomenon has always a quantity which however is not discoverable in apprehension inasmuch as apprehension take place by means of mere sensation in one instant and not by the successive synthesis of many sensations and therefore does not progress from parts to the whole
consequently it has a quantity but not an extensive quantity
apprehension is the kantian word for preception in the largest sense in which we employ that term
it is the genus which includes under i as species perception proper and sensation propertr
now that quantity which is apprehended only as unity and in which plurality can be represented only by approximation to negation o i term intensive quantity
consequently reality in a phenomenon has intensive quantity that is a degree
if we consider this reality as cause be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon for example a change we call the degree of reality in its character of cause a momentum for example the momentum of weight and for this reason that the degree only indicates that quantity the apprehension of which is not successive but instantaneous
this however i touch upon only in passing for with causality i have at present nothing to do
accordingly every sensation consequently every reality in phenomena however small it may be has a degree that is an intensive quantity which may always be lessened and between reality and negation there exists a continuous connection of possible realities and possible smaller perceptions
every colourfor example redhas a degree which be it ever so small is never the smallest and so is it always with heat the momentum of weight etc
this property of quantities according to which no part of them is the smallest possible no part simple is called their continuity
space and time are quanta continua because no part of them can be given without enclosing it within boundaries points and moments consequently this given part is itself a space or a time
space therefore consists only of spaces and time of times
points and moments are only boundaries that is the mere places or positions of their limitation
but places always presuppose intuitions which are to limit or determine them and we cannot conceive either space or time composed of constituent parts which are given before space or time
such quantities may also be called flowing because synthesis of the productive imagination in the production of these quantities is a progression in time the continuity of which we are accustomed to indicate by the expression flowing
all phenomena then are continuous quantities in respect both to intuition and mere perception sensation and with it reality
in the former case they are extensive quantities in the latter intensive
when the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted there results merely an aggregate of several phenomena and not properly a phenomenon as a quantity which is not produced by the mere continuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind but by the repetition of a synthesis always ceasing
for example if i call thirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money i employ the term quite correctly inasmuch as i understand by thirteen dollars the value of a mark in standard silver which is to be sure a continuous quantity in which no part is the smallest but every part might constitute a piece of money which would contain material for still smaller pieces
if however by the words thirteen dollars i understand so many coins be their value in silver what it may it would be quite erroneous to use the expression a quantity of dollars on the contrary i must call them aggregate that is a number of coins
and as in every number we must have unity as the foundation so a phenomenon taken as unity is a quantity and as such always a continuous quantity quantum continuum
now seeing all phenomena whether considered as extensive or intensive are continuous quantities the proposition all change transition of a thing from one state into another is continuous might be proved here easily and with mathematical evidence were it not that the causality of a change lies entirely beyond the bounds of a transcendental philosophy and presupposes empirical principles
for of the possibility of a cause which changes the condition of things that is which determines them to the contrary to a certain given state the understanding gives us priori no knowledge not merely because it has no insight into the possibility of it for such insight is absent in several priori cognitions but because the notion of change concerns only certain determinations of phenomena which experience alone can acquaint us with while their cause lies in the unchangeable
but seeing that we have nothing which we could here employ but the pure fundamental conceptions of all possible experience among which of course nothing empirical can be admitted we dare not without injuring the unity of our system anticipate general physical science which is built upon certain fundamental experiences
nevertheless we are in no want of proofs of the great influence which the principle above developed exercises in the anticipation of perceptions and even in supplying the want of them so far as to shield us against the false conclusions which otherwise we might rashly draw
if all reality in perception has a degree between which and negation there is an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees and if nevertheless every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity for sensations no perception and consequently no experience is possible which can prove either immediately or mediately an entire absence of all reality in a phenomenon in other words it is impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of empty space or of empty time
for in the first place an entire absence of reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of perception secondly such absence cannot be deduced from the contemplation of any single phenomenon and the difference of the degrees in its reality nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation of any phenomenon
for if even the complete intuition of a determinate space or time is thoroughly real that is if no part thereof is empty yet because every reality has its degree which with the extensive quantity of the phenomenon unchanged can diminish through endless gradations down to nothing the void there must be infinitely graduated degrees with which space or time is filled and the intensive quantity in different phenomena may be smaller or greater although the extensive quantity of the intuition remains equal and unaltered
we shall give an example of this
almost all natural philosophers remarking a great difference in the quantity of the matter of different kinds in bodies with the same volume partly on account of the momentum of gravity or weight partly on account of the momentum of resistance to other bodies in motion conclude unanimously that this volume extensive quantity of the phenomenon must be void in all bodies although in different proportion
but who would suspect that these for the most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into nature should ground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesisa sort of hypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid yet this they do in assuming that the real in space i must not here call it impenetrability or weight because these are empirical conceptions is always identical and can only be distinguished according to its extensive quantity that is multiplicity
now to this presupposition for which they can have no ground in experience and which consequently is merely metaphysical i oppose a transcendental demonstration which it is true will not explain the difference in the filling up of spaces but which nevertheless completely does away with the supposed necessity of the abovementioned presupposition that we cannot explain the said difference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty spaces
this demonstration moreover has the merit of setting the understanding at liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner if the explanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis
for we perceive that although two equal spaces may be completely filled by matters altogether different so that in neither of them is there left a single point wherein matter is not present nevertheless every reality has its degree of resistance or of weight which without diminution of the extensive quantity can become less and less ad infinitum before it passes into nothingness and disappears
thus an expansion which fills a spacefor example caloric or any other reality in the phenomenal worldcan decrease in its degrees to infinity yet without leaving the smallest part of the space empty on the contrary filling it with those lesser degrees as completely as another phenomenon could with greater
my intention here is by no means to maintain that this is really the case with the difference of matters in regard to their specific gravity i wish only to prove from a principle of the pure understanding that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode of explanation possible and that it is erroneous to regard the real in a phenomenon as equal quoad its degree and different only quoad its aggregation and extensive quantity and this too on the pretended authority of an priori principle of the understanding
nevertheless this principle of the anticipation of perception must somewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental philosophy has rendered cautious
we must naturally entertain some doubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such synthetical proposition as that respecting the degree of all reality in phenomena and consequently the possibility of the internal difference of sensation itselfabstraction being made of its empirical quality
thus it is a question not unworthy of solution how the understanding can pronounce synthetically and priori respecting phenomena and thus anticipate these even in that which is peculiarly and merely empirical that namely which concerns sensation itself
the quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical and cannot be represented priori for example colours taste etc
but the realthat which corresponds to sensationin opposition to negation only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a being ein seyn and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical consciousness
that is to say the empirical consciousness in the internal sense can be raised from to every higher degree so that the very same extensive quantity of intuition an illuminated surface for example excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other surfaces less illuminated
we can therefore make complete abstraction of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon and represent to ourselves in the mere sensation in a certain momentum a synthesis of homogeneous ascension from up to the given empirical consciousness all sensations therefore as such are given only posteriori but this property thereof namely that they have a degree can be known priori
it is worthy of remark that in respect to quantities in general we can cognize priori only a single quality namely continuity but in respect to all quality the real in phenomena we cannot cognize priori anything more than the intensive quantity thereof namely that they have a degree
all else is left to experience
analogies of experience
the principle of these is experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perceptions
proof
experience is an empirical cognition that is to say a cognition which determines an object by means of perceptions
it is therefore a synthesis of perceptions a synthesis which is not itself contained in perception but which contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of perception in a consciousness and this unity constitutes the essential of our cognition of objects of the senses that is of experience not merely of intuition or sensation
now in experience our perceptions come together contingently so that no character of necessity in their connection appears or can appear from the perceptions themselves because apprehension is only a placing together of the manifold of empirical intuition and no representation of a necessity in the connected existence of the phenomena which apprehension brings together is to be discovered therein
but as experience is a cognition of objects by means of perceptions it follows that the relation of the existence of the existence of the manifold must be represented in experience not as it is put together in time but as it is objectively in time
and as time itself cannot be perceived the determination of the existence of objects in time can only take place by means of their connection in time in general consequently only by means of priori connecting conceptions
now as these conceptions always possess the character of necessity experience is possible only by means of a representation of the necessary connection of perception
the three modi of time are permanence succession and coexistence
accordingly there are three rules of all relations of time in phenomena according to which the existence of every phenomenon is determined in respect of the unity of all time and these antecede all experience and render it possible
the general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessary unity of apperception in relation to all possible empirical consciousness perception at every time consequently as this unity lies priori at the foundation of all mental operations the principle rests on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to their relation in time
for the original apperception relates to our internal sense the complex of all representations and indeed relates priori to its form that is to say the relation of the manifold empirical consciousness in time
now this manifold must be combined in original apperception according to relations of timea necessity imposed by the priori transcendental unity of apperception to which is subjected all that can belong to my i
e
my own cognition and therefore all that can become an object for me
this synthetical and priori determined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore the rule all empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of the general determination of time and the analogies of experience of which we are now about to treat must be rules of this nature
these principles have this peculiarity that they do not concern phenomena and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof but merely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other in regard to this existence
now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determined priori in such a manner that the rule of its synthesis can give that is to say can produce this priori intuition in every empirical example
but the existence of phenomena cannot be known priori and although we could arrive by this path at a conclusion of the fact of some existence we could not cognize that existence determinately that is to say we should be incapable of anticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be distinguishable from that of others
the two principles above mentioned which i called mathematical in consideration of the fact of their authorizing the application of mathematic phenomena relate to these phenomena only in regard to their possibility and instruct us how phenomena as far as regards their intuition or the real in their perception can be generated according to the rules of a mathematical synthesis
consequently numerical quantities and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a quantity can be employed in the one case as well as in the other
thus for example out of illuminations by the moon i might compose and give priori that is construct the degree of our sensations of the sunlight
we may therefore entitle these two principles constitutive
kants meaning is the two principles enunciated under the heads of axioms of intuition and anticipations of perception authorize the application to phenomena of determinations of size and number that is of mathematic
for example i may compute the light of the sun and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater than that of the moon
in the same way heat is measured by the comparison of its different effects on water c
and on mercury in a thermometer
tr
the case is very different with those principles whose province it is to subject the existence of phenomena to rules priori
for as existence does not admit of being constructed it is clear that they must only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulative principles
in this case therefore neither axioms nor anticipations are to be thought of
thus if a perception is given us in a certain relation of time to other although undetermined perceptions we cannot then say priori what and how great in quantity the other perception necessarily connected with the former is but only how it is connected quoad its existence in this given modus of time
analogies in philosophy mean something very different from that which they represent in mathematics
in the latter they are formulae which enounce the equality of two relations of quantity and are always constitutive so that if two terms of the proportion are given the third is also given that is can be constructed by the aid of these formulae
but in philosophy analogy is not the equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relations
in this case from three given terms i can give priori and cognize the relation to a fourth member but not this fourth term itself although i certainly possess a rule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience and a mark to assist me in discovering it
an analogy of experience is therefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must arise out of perceptions in respect to objects phenomena not as a constitutive but merely as a regulative principle
the same holds good also of the postulates of empirical thought in general which relate to the synthesis of mere intuition which concerns the form of phenomena the synthesis of perception which concerns the matter of phenomena and the synthesis of experience which concerns the relation of these perceptions
for they are only regulative principles and clearly distinguishable from the mathematical which are constitutive not indeed in regard to the certainty which both possess priori but in the mode of evidence thereof consequently also in the manner of demonstration
but what has been observed of all synthetical propositions and must be particularly remarked in this place is this that these analogies possess significance and validity not as principles of the transcendental but only as principles of the empirical use of the understanding and their truth can therefore be proved only as such and that consequently the phenomena must not be subjoined directly under the categories but only under their schemata
for if the objects to which those principles must be applied were things in themselves it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them synthetically priori
but they are nothing but phenomena a complete knowledge of whicha knowledge to which all principles priori must at last relateis the only possible experience
it follows that these principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of the empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena
but this synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding of whose unity as that of a synthesis in general the category contains the function unrestricted by any sensuous condition
these principles will therefore authorize us to connect phenomena according to an analogy with the logical and universal unity of conceptions and consequently to employ the categories in the principles themselves but in the application of them to experience we shall use only their schemata as the key to their proper application instead of the categories or rather the latter as restricting conditions under the title of formulae of the former
a
first analogy
principle of the permanence of substance
in all changes of phenomena substance is permanent and the quantum thereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished
proof
all phenomena exist in time wherein alone as substratum that is as the permanent form of the internal intuition coexistence and succession can be represented
consequently time in which all changes of phenomena must be cogitated remains and changes not because it is that in which succession and coexistence can be represented only as determinations thereof
now time in itself cannot be an object of perception
it follows that in objects of perception that is in phenomena there must be found a substratum which represents time in general and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived by means of the relation of phenomena to it
but the substratum of all reality that is of all that pertains to the existence of things is substance all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a determination of substance
consequently the permanent in relation to which alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined is substance in the world of phenomena that is the real in phenomena that which as the substratum of all change remains ever the same
accordingly as this cannot change in existence its quantity in nature can neither be increased nor diminished
our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive is consequently always changing
by it alone we could therefore never determine whether this manifold as an object of experience is coexistent or successive unless it had for a foundation something fixed and permanent of the existence of which all succession and coexistence are nothing but so many modes modi of time
only in the permanent then are relations of time possible for simultaneity and succession are the only relations in time that is to say the permanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of time itself in which alone all determination of time is possible
permanence is in fact just another expression for time as the abiding correlate of all existence of phenomena and of all change and of all coexistence
for change does not affect time itself but only the phenomena in time just as coexistence cannot be regarded as a modus of time itself seeing that in time no parts are coexistent but all successive
if we were to attribute succession to time itself we should be obliged to cogitate another time in which this succession would be possible
it is only by means of the permanent that existence in different parts of the successive series of time receives a quantity which we entitle duration
for in mere succession existence is perpetually vanishing and recommencing and therefore never has even the least quantity
without the permanent then no relation in time is possible
now time in itself is not an object of perception consequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded as the substratum of all determination of time and consequently also as the condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions that is of experience and all existence and all change in time can only be regarded as a mode in the existence of that which abides unchangeably
therefore in all phenomena the permanent is the object in itself that is the substance phenomenon but all that changes or can change belongs only to the mode of the existence of this substance or substances consequently to its determinations
i find that in all ages not only the philosopher but even the common understanding has preposited this permanence as a substratum of all change in phenomena indeed i am compelled to believe that they will always accept this as an indubitable fact
only the philosopher expresses himself in a more precise and definite manner when he says in all changes in the world the substance remains and the accidents alone are changeable
but of this decidedly synthetical proposition i nowhere meet with even an attempt at proof nay it very rarely has the good fortune to stand as it deserves to do at the head of the pure and entirely priori laws of nature
in truth the statement that substance is permanent is tautological
for this very permanence is the ground on which we apply the category of substance to the phenomenon and we should have been obliged to prove that in all phenomena there is something permanent of the existence of which the changeable is nothing but a determination
but because a proof of this nature cannot be dogmatical that is cannot be drawn from conceptions inasmuch as it concerns a synthetical proposition priori and as philosophers never reflected that such propositions are valid only in relation to possible experience and therefore cannot be proved except by means of a deduction of the possibility of experience it is no wonder that while it has served as the foundation of all experience for we feel the need of it in empirical cognition it has never been supported by proof
a philosopher was asked what is the weight of smoke he answered subtract from the weight of the burnt wood the weight of the remaining ashes and you will have the weight of the smoke
thus he presumed it to be incontrovertible that even in fire the matter substance does not perish but that only the form of it undergoes a change
in like manner was the saying from nothing comes nothing only another inference from the principle or permanence or rather of the everabiding existence of the true subject in phenomena
for if that in the phenomenon which we call substance is to be the proper substratum of all determination of time it follows that all existence in past as well as in future time must be determinable by means of it alone
hence we are entitled to apply the term substance to a phenomenon only because we suppose its existence in all time a notion which the word permanence does not fully express as it seems rather to be referable to future time
however the internal necessity perpetually to be is inseparably connected with the necessity always to have been and so the expression may stand as it is
gigni de nihilo nihil in nihilum nil posse reverti are two propositions which the ancients never parted and which people nowadays sometimes mistakenly disjoin because they imagine that the propositions apply to objects as things in themselves and that the former might be inimical to the dependence even in respect of its substance also of the world upon a supreme cause
but this apprehension is entirely needless for the question in this case is only of phenomena in the sphere of experience the unity of which never could be possible if we admitted the possibility that new things in respect of their substance should arise
for in that case we should lose altogether that which alone can represent the unity of time to wit the identity of the substratum as that through which alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity
this permanence is however nothing but the manner in which we represent to ourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world
persius satirae iii
the determinations of a substance which are only particular modes of its existence are called accidents
they are always real because they concern the existence of substance negations are only determinations which express the nonexistence of something in the substance
now if to this real in the substance we ascribe a particular existence for example to motion as an accident of matter this existence is called inherence in contradistinction to the existence of substance which we call subsistence
but hence arise many misconceptions and it would be a more accurate and just mode of expression to designate the accident only as the mode in which the existence of a substance is positively determined
meanwhile by reason of the conditions of the logical exercise of our understanding it is impossible to avoid separating as it were that which in the existence of a substance is subject to change whilst the substance remains and regarding it in relation to that which is properly permanent and radical
on this account this category of substance stands under the title of relation rather because it is the condition thereof than because it contains in itself any relation
now upon this notion of permanence rests the proper notion of the conception change
origin and extinction are not changes of that which originates or becomes extinct
change is but a mode of existence which follows on another mode of existence of the same object hence all that changes is permanent and only the condition thereof changes
now since this mutation affects only determinations which can have a beginning or an end we may say employing an expression which seems somewhat paradoxical only the permanent substance is subject to change the mutable suffers no change but rather alternation that is when certain determinations cease others begin
change when cannot be perceived by us except in substances and origin or extinction in an absolute sense that does not concern merely a determination of the permanent cannot be a possible perception for it is this very notion of the permanent which renders possible the representation of a transition from one state into another and from nonbeing to being which consequently can be empirically cognized only as alternating determinations of that which is permanent
grant that a thing absolutely begins to be we must then have a point of time in which it was not
but how and by what can we fix and determine this point of time unless by that which already exists for a void timeprecedingis not an object of perception but if we connect this beginning with objects which existed previously and which continue to exist till the object in question in question begins to be then the latter can only be a determination of the former as the permanent
the same holds good of the notion of extinction for this presupposes the empirical representation of a time in which a phenomenon no longer exists
substances in the world of phenomena are the substratum of all determinations of time
the beginning of some and the ceasing to be of other substances would utterly do away with the only condition of the empirical unity of time and in that case phenomena would relate to two different times in which side by side existence would pass which is absurd
for there is only one time in which all different times must be placed not as coexistent but as successive
accordingly permanence is a necessary condition under which alone phenomena as things or objects are determinable in a possible experience
but as regards the empirical criterion of this necessary permanence and with it of the substantiality of phenomena we shall find sufficient opportunity to speak in the sequel
b
second analogy
principle of the succession of time according to the law of causality
all changes take place according to the law of the connection of cause and effect
proof
that all phenomena in the succession of time are only changes that is a successive being and nonbeing of the determinations of substance which is permanent consequently that a being of substance itself which follows on the nonbeing thereof or a nonbeing of substance which follows on the being thereof in other words that the origin or extinction of substance itself is impossibleall this has been fully established in treating of the foregoing principle
this principle might have been expressed as follows all alteration succession of phenomena is merely change for the changes of substance are not origin or extinction because the conception of change presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite determinations and consequently as permanent
after this premonition we shall proceed to the proof
i perceive that phenomena succeed one another that is to say a state of things exists at one time the opposite of which existed in a former state
in this case then i really connect together two perceptions in time
now connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition but is the product of a synthetical faculty of imagination which determines the internal sense in respect of a relation of time
but imagination can connect these two states in two ways so that either the one or the other may antecede in time for time in itself cannot be an object of perception and what in an object precedes and what follows cannot be empirically determined in relation to it
i am only conscious then that my imagination places one state before and the other after not that the one state antecedes the other in the object
in other words the objective relation of the successive phenomena remains quite undetermined by means of mere perception
now in order that this relation may be cognized as determined the relation between the two states must be so cogitated that it is thereby determined as necessary which of them must be placed before and which after and not conversely
but the conception which carries with it a necessity of synthetical unity can be none other than a pure conception of the understanding which does not lie in mere perception and in this case it is the conception of the relation of cause and effect the former of which determines the latter in time as its necessary consequence and not as something which might possibly antecede or which might in some cases not be perceived to follow
it follows that it is only because we subject the sequence of phenomena and consequently all change to the law of causality that experience itself that is empirical cognition of phenomena becomes possible and consequently that phenomena themselves as objects of experience are possible only by virtue of this law
our apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive
the representations of parts succeed one another
whether they succeed one another in the object also is a second point for reflection which was not contained in the former
now we may certainly give the name of object to everything even to every representation so far as we are conscious thereof but what this word may mean in the case of phenomena not merely in so far as they as representations are objects but only in so far as they indicate an object is a question requiring deeper consideration
in so far as they regarded merely as representations are at the same time objects of consciousness they are not to be distinguished from apprehension that is reception into the synthesis of imagination and we must therefore say the manifold of phenomena is always produced successively in the mind
if phenomena were things in themselves no man would be able to conjecture from the succession of our representations how this manifold is connected in the object for we have to do only with our representations
how things may be in themselves without regard to the representations through which they affect us is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition
now although phenomena are not things in themselves and are nevertheless the only thing given to us to be cognized it is my duty to show what sort of connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomena themselves while the representation of this manifold in apprehension is always successive
for example the apprehension of the manifold in the phenomenon of a house which stands before me is successive
now comes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itself successivewhich no one will be at all willing to grant
but so soon as i raise my conception of an object to the transcendental signification thereof i find that the house is not a thing in itself but only a phenomenon that is a representation the transcendental object of which remains utterly unknown
what then am i to understand by the question how can the manifold be connected in the phenomenon itselfnot considered as a thing in itself but merely as a phenomenon here that which lies in my successive apprehension is regarded as representation whilst the phenomenon which is given me notwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of these representations is regarded as the object thereof with which my conception drawn from the representations of apprehension must harmonize
it is very soon seen that as accordance of the cognition with its object constitutes truth the question now before us can only relate to the formal conditions of empirical truth and that the phenomenon in opposition to the representations of apprehension can only be distinguished therefrom as the object of them if it is subject to a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension and which renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold
that in the phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of apprehension is the object
let us now proceed to our task
that something happens that is to say that something or some state exists which before was not cannot be empirically perceived unless a phenomenon precedes which does not contain in itself this state
for a reality which should follow upon a void time in other words a beginning which no state of things precedes can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself
every apprehension of an event is therefore a perception which follows upon another perception
but as this is the case with all synthesis of apprehension as i have shown above in the example of a house my apprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from other apprehensions
but i remark also that if in a phenomenon which contains an occurrence i call the antecedent state of my perception a and the following state b the perception b can only follow a in apprehension and the perception a cannot follow b but only precede it
for example i see a ship float down the stream of a river
my perception of its place lower down follows upon my perception of its place higher up the course of the river and it is impossible that in the apprehension of this phenomenon the vessel should be perceived first below and afterwards higher up the stream
here therefore the order in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined and by this order apprehension is regulated
in the former example my perceptions in the apprehension of a house might begin at the roof and end at the foundation or vice versa or i might apprehend the manifold in this empirical intuition by going from left to right and from right to left
accordingly in the series of these perceptions there was no determined order which necessitated my beginning at a certain point in order empirically to connect the manifold
but this rule is always to be met with in the perception of that which happens and it makes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of such a phenomenon necessary
i must therefore in the present case deduce the subjective sequence of apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena for otherwise the former is quite undetermined and one phenomenon is not distinguishable from another
the former alone proves nothing as to the connection of the manifold in an object for it is quite arbitrary
the latter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon according to which order the apprehension of one thing that which happens follows that of another thing which precedes in conformity with a rule
in this way alone can i be authorized to say of the phenomenon itself and not merely of my own apprehension that a certain order or sequence is to be found therein
that is in other words i cannot arrange my apprehension otherwise than in this order
in conformity with this rule then it is necessary that in that which antecedes an event there be found the condition of a rule according to which in this event follows always and necessarily but i cannot reverse this and go back from the event and determine by apprehension that which antecedes it
for no phenomenon goes back from the succeeding point of time to the preceding point although it does certainly relate to a preceding point of time from a given time on the other hand there is always a necessary progression to the determined succeeding time
therefore because there certainly is something that follows i must of necessity connect it with something else which antecedes and upon which it follows in conformity with a rule that is necessarily so that the event as conditioned affords certain indication of a condition and this condition determines the event
let us suppose that nothing precedes an event upon which this event must follow in conformity with a rule
all sequence of perception would then exist only in apprehension that is to say would be merely subjective and it could not thereby be objectively determined what thing ought to precede and what ought to follow in perception
in such a case we should have nothing but a play of representations which would possess no application to any object
that is to say it would not be possible through perception to distinguish one phenomenon from another as regards relations of time because the succession in the act of apprehension would always be of the same sort and therefore there would be nothing in the phenomenon to determine the succession and to render a certain sequence objectively necessary
and in this case i cannot say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon the other but only that one apprehension follows upon another
but this is merely subjective and does not determine an object and consequently cannot be held to be cognition of an objectnot even in the phenomenal world
accordingly when we know in experience that something happens we always presuppose that something precedes whereupon it follows in conformity with a rule
for otherwise i could not say of the object that it follows because the mere succession in my apprehension if it be not determined by a rule in relation to something preceding does not authorize succession in the object
only therefore in reference to a rule according to which phenomena are determined in their sequence that is as they happen by the preceding state can i make my subjective synthesis of apprehension objective and it is only under this presupposition that even the experience of an event is possible
no doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to all the notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to the procedure of the human understanding
according to these opinions it is by means of the perception and comparison of similar consequences following upon certain antecedent phenomena that the understanding is led to the discovery of a rule according to which certain events always follow certain phenomena and it is only by this process that we attain to the conception of cause
upon such a basis it is clear that this conception must be merely empirical and the rule which it furnishes us witheverything that happens must have a causewould be just as contingent as experience itself
the universality and necessity of the rule or law would be perfectly spurious attributes of it
indeed it could not possess universal validity inasmuch as it would not in this case be priori but founded on deduction
but the same is the case with this law as with other pure priori representations e
g
space and time which we can draw in perfect clearness and completeness from experience only because we had already placed them therein and by that means and by that alone had rendered experience possible
indeed the logical clearness of this representation of a rule determining the series of events is possible only when we have made use thereof in experience
nevertheless the recognition of this rule as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time was the ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it priori
it is now our duty to show by an example that we never even in experience attribute to an object the notion of succession or effect of an eventthat is the happening of something that did not exist before and distinguish it from the subjective succession of apprehension unless when a rule lies at the foundation which compels us to observe this order of perception in preference to any other and that indeed it is this necessity which first renders possible the representation of a succession in the object
we have representations within us of which also we can be conscious
but however widely extended however accurate and thoroughgoing this consciousness may be these representations are still nothing more than representations that is internal determinations of the mind in this or that relation of time
now how happens it that to these representations we should set an object or that in addition to their subjective reality as modifications we should still further attribute to them a certain unknown objective reality it is clear that objective significancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation of that which we desire to term object for in that case the question again arises how does this other representation go out of itself and obtain objective significancy over and above the subjective which is proper to it as a determination of a state of mind if we try to discover what sort of new property the relation to an object gives to our subjective representations and what new importance they thereby receive we shall find that this relation has no other effect than that of rendering necessary the connection of our representations in a certain manner and of subjecting them to a rule and that conversely it is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations of time of our representations that objective significancy is ascribed to them
in the synthesis of phenomena the manifold of our representations is always successive
now hereby is not represented an object for by means of this succession which is common to all apprehension no one thing is distinguished from another
but so soon as i perceive or assume that in this succession there is a relation to a state antecedent from which the representation follows in accordance with a rule so soon do i represent something as an event or as a thing that happens in other words i cognize an object to which i must assign a certain determinate position in time which cannot be altered because of the preceding state in the object
when therefore i perceive that something happens there is contained in this representation in the first place the fact that something antecedes because it is only in relation to this that the phenomenon obtains its proper relation of time in other words exists after an antecedent time in which it did not exist
but it can receive its determined place in time only by the presupposition that something existed in the foregoing state upon which it follows inevitably and always that is in conformity with a rule
from all this it is evident that in the first place i cannot reverse the order of succession and make that which happens precede that upon which it follows and that in the second place if the antecedent state be posited a certain determinate event inevitably and necessarily follows
hence it follows that there exists a certain order in our representations whereby the present gives a sure indication of some previously existing state as a correlate though still undetermined of the existing event which is givena correlate which itself relates to the event as its consequence conditions it and connects it necessarily with itself in the series of time
if then it be admitted as a necessary law of sensibility and consequently a formal condition of all perception that the preceding necessarily determines the succeeding time inasmuch as i cannot arrive at the succeeding except through the preceding it must likewise be an indispensable law of empirical representation of the series of time that the phenomena of the past determine all phenomena in the succeeding time and that the latter as events cannot take place except in so far as the former determine their existence in time that is to say establish it according to a rule
for it is of course only in phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in the connection of times
for all experience and for the possibility of experience understanding is indispensable and the first step which it takes in this sphere is not to render the representation of objects clear but to render the representation of an object in general possible
it does this by applying the order of time to phenomena and their existence
in other words it assigns to each phenomenon as a consequence a place in relation to preceding phenomena determined priori in time without which it could not harmonize with time itself which determines a place priori to all its parts
this determination of place cannot be derived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time for it is not an object of perception but on the contrary phenomena must reciprocally determine the places in time of one another and render these necessary in the order of time
in other words whatever follows or happens must follow in conformity with a universal rule upon that which was contained in the foregoing state
hence arises a series of phenomena which by means of the understanding produces and renders necessary exactly the same order and continuous connection in the series of our possible perceptions as is found priori in the form of internal intuition time in which all our perceptions must have place
that something happens then is a perception which belongs to a possible experience which becomes real only because i look upon the phenomenon as determined in regard to its place in time consequently as an object which can always be found by means of a rule in the connected series of my perceptions
but this rule of the determination of a thing according to succession in time is as follows in what precedes may be found the condition under which an event always that is necessarily follows
from all this it is obvious that the principle of cause and effect is the principle of possible experience that is of objective cognition of phenomena in regard to their relations in the succession of time
the proof of this fundamental proposition rests entirely on the following momenta of argument
to all empirical cognition belongs the synthesis of the manifold by the imagination a synthesis which is always successive that is in which the representations therein always follow one another
but the order of succession in imagination is not determined and the series of successive representations may be taken retrogressively as well as progressively
but if this synthesis is a synthesis of apprehension of the manifold of a given phenomenon then the order is determined in the object or to speak more accurately there is therein an order of successive synthesis which determines an object and according to which something necessarily precedes and when this is posited something else necessarily follows
if then my perception is to contain the cognition of an event that is of something which really happens it must be an empirical judgement wherein we think that the succession is determined that is it presupposes another phenomenon upon which this event follows necessarily or in conformity with a rule
if on the contrary when i posited the antecedent the event did not necessarily follow i should be obliged to consider it merely as a subjective play of my imagination and if in this i represented to myself anything as objective i must look upon it as a mere dream
thus the relation of phenomena as possible perceptions according to which that which happens is as to its existence necessarily determined in time by something which antecedes in conformity with a rulein other words the relation of cause and effectis the condition of the objective validity of our empirical judgements in regard to the sequence of perceptions consequently of their empirical truth and therefore of experience
the principle of the relation of causality in the succession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects of experience because it is itself the ground of the possibility of experience
here however a difficulty arises which must be resolved
the principle of the connection of causality among phenomena is limited in our formula to the succession thereof although in practice we find that the principle applies also when the phenomena exist together in the same time and that cause and effect may be simultaneous
for example there is heat in a room which does not exist in the open air
i look about for the cause and find it to be the fire now the fire as the cause is simultaneous with its effect the heat of the room
in this case then there is no succession as regards time between cause and effect but they are simultaneous and still the law holds good
the greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous with their effects and the succession in time of the latter is produced only because the cause cannot achieve the total of its effect in one moment
but at the moment when the effect first arises it is always simultaneous with the causality of its cause because if the cause had but a moment before ceased to be the effect could not have arisen
here it must be specially remembered that we must consider the order of time and not the lapse thereof
the relation remains even though no time has elapsed
the time between the causality of the cause and its immediate effect may entirely vanish and the cause and effect be thus simultaneous but the relation of the one to the other remains always determinable according to time
if for example i consider a leaden ball which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it as a cause then it is simultaneous with the effect
but i distinguish the two through the relation of time of the dynamical connection of both
for if i lay the ball upon the cushion then the hollow follows upon the before smooth surface but supposing the cushion has from some cause or another a hollow there does not thereupon follow a leaden ball
thus the law of succession of time is in all instances the only empirical criterion of effect in relation to the causality of the antecedent cause
the glass is the cause of the rising of the water above its horizontal surface although the two phenomena are contemporaneous
for as soon as i draw some water with the glass from a larger vessel an effect follows thereupon namely the change of the horizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into a concave which it assumes in the glass
this conception of causality leads us to the conception of action that of action to the conception of force and through it to the conception of substance
as i do not wish this critical essay the sole purpose of which is to treat of the sources of our synthetical cognition priori to be crowded with analyses which merely explain but do not enlarge the sphere of our conceptions i reserve the detailed explanation of the above conceptions for a future system of pure reason
such an analysis indeed executed with great particularity may already be found in wellknown works on this subject
but i cannot at present refrain from making a few remarks on the empirical criterion of a substance in so far as it seems to be more evident and more easily recognized through the conception of action than through that of the permanence of a phenomenon
where action consequently activity and force exists substance also must exist and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitful source of phenomena
very well
but if we are called upon to explain what we mean by substance and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in a circle the answer is by no means so easy
how shall we conclude immediately from the action to the permanence of that which acts this being nevertheless an essential and peculiar criterion of substance phenomenon but after what has been said above the solution of this question becomes easy enough although by the common mode of proceduremerely analysing our conceptionsit would be quite impossible
the conception of action indicates the relation of the subject of causality to the effect
now because all effect consists in that which happens therefore in the changeable the last subject thereof is the permanent as the substratum of all that changes that is substance
for according to the principle of causality actions are always the first ground of all change in phenomena and consequently cannot be a property of a subject which itself changes because if this were the case other actions and another subject would be necessary to determine this change
from all this it results that action alone as an empirical criterion is a sufficient proof of the presence of substantiality without any necessity on my part of endeavouring to discover the permanence of substance by a comparison
besides by this mode of induction we could not attain to the completeness which the magnitude and strict universality of the conception requires
for that the primary subject of the causality of all arising and passing away all origin and extinction cannot itself in the sphere of phenomena arise and pass away is a sound and safe conclusion a conclusion which leads us to the conception of empirical necessity and permanence in existence and consequently to the conception of a substance as phenomenon
when something happens the mere fact of the occurrence without regard to that which occurs is an object requiring investigation
the transition from the nonbeing of a state into the existence of it supposing that this state contains no quality which previously existed in the phenomenon is a fact of itself demanding inquiry
such an event as has been shown in no
a does not concern substance for substance does not thus originate but its condition or state
it is therefore only change and not origin from nothing
if this origin be regarded as the effect of a foreign cause it is termed creation which cannot be admitted as an event among phenomena because the very possibility of it would annihilate the unity of experience
if however i regard all things not as phenomena but as things in themselves and objects of understanding alone they although substances may be considered as dependent in respect of their existence on a foreign cause
but this would require a very different meaning in the words a meaning which could not apply to phenomena as objects of possible experience
how a thing can be changed how it is possible that upon one state existing in one point of time an opposite state should follow in another point of timeof this we have not the smallest conception priori
there is requisite for this the knowledge of real powers which can only be given empirically for example knowledge of moving forces or in other words of certain successive phenomena as movements which indicate the presence of such forces
but the form of every change the condition under which alone it can take place as the coming into existence of another state be the content of the change that is the state which is changed what it may and consequently the succession of the states themselves can very well be considered priori in relation to the law of causality and the conditions of time
it must be remarked that i do not speak of the change of certain relations but of the change of the state
thus when a body moves in a uniform manner it does not change its state of motion but only when all motion increases or decreases
when a substance passes from one state a into another state b the point of time in which the latter exists is different from and subsequent to that in which the former existed
in like manner the second state as reality in the phenomenon differs from the first in which the reality of the second did not exist as b from zero
that is to say if the state b differs from the state a only in respect to quantity the change is a coming into existence of b a which in the former state did not exist and in relation to which that state is o
now the question arises how a thing passes from one state a into another state b
between two moments there is always a certain time and between two states existing in these moments there is always a difference having a certain quantity for all parts of phenomena are in their turn quantities
consequently every transition from one state into another is always effected in a time contained between two moments of which the first determines the state which leaves and the second determines the state into the thing passes
the thing leaves and the second determines the state into which the thing both moments then are limitations of the time of a change consequently of the intermediate state between both and as such they belong to the total of the change
now every change has a cause which evidences its causality in the whole time during which the charge takes place
the cause therefore does not produce the change all at once or in one moment but in a time so that as the time gradually increases from the commencing instant a to its completion at b in like manner also the quantity of the reality b a is generated through the lesser degrees which are contained between the first and last
all change is therefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality which in so far as it is uniform we call a momentum
the change does not consist of these momenta but is generated or produced by them as their effect
such is the law of the continuity of all change the ground of which is that neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of parts which are the smallest possible but that notwithstanding the state of a thing passes in the process of a change through all these parts as elements to its second state
there is no smallest degree of reality in a phenomenon just as there is no smallest degree in the quantity of time and so the new state of reality grows up out of the former state through all the infinite degrees thereof the differences of which one from another taken all together are less than the difference between o and a
it is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this principle in the investigation of nature
but how such a proposition which appears so greatly to extend our knowledge of nature is possible completely priori is indeed a question which deserves investigation although the first view seems to demonstrate the truth and reality of the principle and the question how it is possible may be considered superfluous
for there are so many groundless pretensions to the enlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must take it as a general rule to be mistrustful of all such and without a thoroughgoing and radical deduction to believe nothing of the sort even on the clearest dogmatical evidence
every addition to our empirical knowledge and every advance made in the exercise of our perception is nothing more than an extension of the determination of the internal sense that is to say a progression in time be objects themselves what they may phenomena or pure intuitions
this progression in time determines everything and is itself determined by nothing else
that is to say the parts of the progression exist only in time and by means of the synthesis thereof and are not given antecedently to it
for this reason every transition in perception to anything which follows upon another in time is a determination of time by means of the production of this perception
and as this determination of time is always and in all its parts a quantity the perception produced is to be considered as a quantity which proceeds through all its degreesno one of which is the smallest possiblefrom zero up to its determined degree
from this we perceive the possibility of cognizing priori a law of changesa law however which concerns their form merely
we merely anticipate our own apprehension the formal condition of which inasmuch as it is itself to be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena must certainly be capable of being cognized priori
thus as time contains the sensuous condition priori of the possibility of a continuous progression of that which exists to that which follows it the understanding by virtue of the unity of apperception contains the condition priori of the possibility of a continuous determination of the position in time of all phenomena and this by means of the series of causes and effects the former of which necessitate the sequence of the latter and thereby render universally and for all time and by consequence objectively valid the empirical cognition of the relations of time

third analogy
principle of coexistence according to the law of reciprocity or community
all substances in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same time exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action
proof
things are coexistent when in empirical intuition the perception of the one can follow upon the perception of the other and vice versawhich cannot occur in the succession of phenomena as we have shown in the explanation of the second principle
thus i can perceive the moon and then the earth or conversely first the earth and then the moon and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects can reciprocally follow each other i say they exist contemporaneously
now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time
but time itself is not an object of perception and therefore we cannot conclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time the other fact that the perception of these things can follow each other reciprocally
the synthesis of the imagination in apprehension would only present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subject when the other is not present and contrariwise but would not show that the objects are coexistent that is to say that if the one exists the other also exists in the same time and that this is necessarily so in order that the perceptions may be capable of following each other reciprocally
it follows that a conception of the understanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of the determinations of phenomena existing as they do apart from each other and yet contemporaneously is requisite to justify us in saying that the reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in the object and to enable us to represent coexistence as objective
but that relation of substances in which the one contains determinations the ground of which is in the other substance is the relation of influence
and when this influence is reciprocal it is the relation of community or reciprocity
consequently the coexistence of substances in space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under the precondition of their reciprocal action
this is therefore the condition of the possibility of things themselves as objects of experience
things are coexistent in so far as they exist in one and the same time
but how can we know that they exist in one and the same time only by observing that the order in the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold is arbitrary and a matter of indifference that is to say that it can proceed from a through b c d to e or contrariwise from e to a
for if they were successive in time and in the order let us suppose which begins with a it is quite impossible for the apprehension in perception to begin with e and go backwards to a inasmuch as a belongs to past time and therefore cannot be an object of apprehension
let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena each is completely isolated that is that no one acts upon another
then i say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object of possible perception and that the existence of one cannot by any mode of empirical synthesis lead us to the existence of another
for we imagine them in this case to be separated by a completely void space and thus perception which proceeds from the one to the other in time would indeed determine their existence by means of a following perception but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the one phenomenon follows objectively upon the first or is coexistent with it
besides the mere fact of existence then there must be something by means of which a determines the position of b in time and conversely b the position of a because only under this condition can substances be empirically represented as existing contemporaneously
now that alone determines the position of another thing in time which is the cause of it or of its determinations
consequently every substance inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of it only in respect of its determinations must contain the causality of certain determinations in another substance and at the same time the effects of the causality of the other in itself
that is to say substances must stand mediately or immediately in dynamical community with each other if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience
but in regard to objects of experience that is absolutely necessary without which the experience of these objects would itself be impossible
consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substances in the world of phenomena in so far as they are coexistent stand in a relation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other
the word community has in our language two meanings and contains the two notions conveyed in the latin communio and commercium
we employ it in this place in the latter sensethat of a dynamical community without which even the community of place communio spatii could not be empirically cognized
in our experiences it is easy to observe that it is only the continuous influences in all parts of space that can conduct our senses from one object to another that the light which plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies produces a mediating community between them and us and thereby evidences their coexistence with us that we cannot empirically change our position perceive this change unless the existence of matter throughout the whole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions we occupy and that this perception can prove the contemporaneous existence of these places only through their reciprocal influence and thereby also the coexistence of even the most remote objectsalthough in this case the proof is only mediate
without community every perception of a phenomenon in space is separated from every other and isolated and the chain of empirical representations that is of experience must with the appearance of a new object begin entirely de novo without the least connection with preceding representations and without standing towards these even in the relation of time
my intention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space for it may exist where our perceptions cannot exist inasmuch as they cannot reach thereto and where therefore no empirical perception of coexistence takes place
but in this case it is not an object of possible experience
german
the following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation
in the mind all phenomena as contents of a possible experience must exist in community communio of apperception or consciousness and in so far as it is requisite that objects be represented as coexistent and connected in so far must they reciprocally determine the position in time of each other and thereby constitute a whole
if this subjective community is to rest upon an objective basis or to be applied to substances as phenomena the perception of one substance must render possible the perception of another and conversely
for otherwise succession which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions would be predicated of external objects and their representation of their coexistence be thus impossible
but this is a reciprocal influence that is to say a real community commercium of substances without which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would be a notion beyond the reach of our minds
by virtue of this commercium phenomena in so far as they are apart from and nevertheless in connection with each other constitute a compositum reale
such composita are possible in many different ways
the three dynamical relations then from which all others spring are those of inherence consequence and composition
these then are the three analogies of experience
they are nothing more than principles of the determination of the existence of phenomena in time according to the three modi of this determination to wit the relation to time itself as a quantity the quantity of existence that is duration the relation in time as a series or succession finally the relation in time as the complex of all existence simultaneity
this unity of determination in regard to time is thoroughly dynamical that is to say time is not considered as that in which experience determines immediately to every existence its position for this is impossible inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of perception by means of which phenomena can be connected with each other
on the contrary the rule of the understanding through which alone the existence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regards relations of time determines for every phenomenon its position in time and consequently priori and with validity for all and every time
by nature in the empirical sense of the word we understand the totality of phenomena connected in respect of their existence according to necessary rules that is laws
there are therefore certain laws which are moreover priori which make nature possible and all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience and by virtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomes possible
the purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to us the unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certain exponents the only business of which is to express the relation of time in so far as it contains all existence in itself to the unity of apperception which can exist in synthesis only according to rules
the combined expression of all is this all phenomena exist in one nature and must so exist inasmuch as without this priori unity no unity of experience and consequently no determination of objects in experience is possible
as regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating of these transcendental laws of nature and the peculiar character of we must make one remark which will at the same time be important as a guide in every other attempt to demonstrate the truth of intellectual and likewise synthetical propositions priori
had we endeavoured to prove these analogies dogmatically that is from conceptions that is to say had we employed this method in attempting to show that everything which exists exists only in that which is permanentthat every thing or event presupposes the existence of something in a preceding state upon which it follows in conformity with a rulelastly that in the manifold which is coexistent the states coexist in connection with each other according to a rule all our labour would have been utterly in vain
for more conceptions of things analyse them as we may cannot enable us to conclude from the existence of one object to the existence of another
what other course was left for us to pursue this only to demonstrate the possibility of experience as a cognition in which at last all objects must be capable of being presented to us if the representation of them is to possess any objective reality
now in this third this mediating term the essential form of which consists in the synthetical unity of the apperception of all phenomena we found priori conditions of the universal and necessary determination as to time of all existences in the world of phenomena without which the empirical determination thereof as to time would itself be impossible and we also discovered rules of synthetical unity priori by means of which we could anticipate experience
for want of this method and from the fancy that it was possible to discover a dogmatical proof of the synthetical propositions which are requisite in the empirical employment of the understanding has it happened that a proof of the principle of sufficient reason has been so often attempted and always in vain
the other two analogies nobody has ever thought of although they have always been silently employed by the mind because the guiding thread furnished by the categories was wanting the guide which alone can enable us to discover every hiatus both in the system of conceptions and of principles
the unity of the universe in which all phenomena to be connected is evidently a mere consequence of the admitted principle of the community of all substances which are coexistent
for were substances isolated they could not as parts constitute a whole and were their connection reciprocal action of the manifold not necessary from the very fact of coexistence we could not conclude from the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former as a real one
we have however shown in its place that community is the proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of coexistence and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter to the former as its condition
the postulates of empirical thought
that which agrees with the formal conditions intuition and conception of experience is possible
that which coheres with the material conditions of experience sensation is real
that whose coherence with the real is determined according to universal conditions of experience is exists necessary
explanation
the categories of modality possess this peculiarity that they do not in the least determine the object or enlarge the conception to which they are annexed as predicates but only express its relation to the faculty of cognition
though my conception of a thing is in itself complete i am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merely possible or whether it is also real or if the latter whether it is also necessary
but hereby the object itself is not more definitely determined in thought but the question is only in what relation it including all its determinations stands to the understanding and its employment in experience to the empirical faculty of judgement and to the reason of its application to experience
for this very reason too the categories of modality are nothing more than explanations of the conceptions of possibility reality and necessity as employed in experience and at the same time restrictions of all the categories to empirical use alone not authorizing the transcendental employment of them
for if they are to have something more than a merely logical significance and to be something more than a mere analytical expression of the form of thought and to have a relation to things and their possibility reality or necessity they must concern possible experience and its synthetical unity in which alone objects of cognition can be given
the postulate of the possibility of things requires also that the conception of the things agree with the formal conditions of our experience in general
but this that is to say the objective form of experience contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite for the cognition of objects
a conception which contains a synthesis must be regarded as empty and without reference to an object if its synthesis does not belong to experienceeither as borrowed from it and in this case it is called an empirical conception or such as is the ground and priori condition of experience its form and in this case it is a pure conception a conception which nevertheless belongs to experience inasmuch as its object can be found in this alone
for where shall we find the criterion or character of the possibility of an object which is cogitated by means of an priori synthetical conception if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form of empirical cognition of objects that in such a conception no contradiction exists is indeed a necessary logical condition but very far from being sufficient to establish the objective reality of the conception that is the possibility of such an object as is thought in the conception
thus in the conception of a figure which is contained within two straight lines there is no contradiction for the conceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no negation of a figure
the impossibility in such a case does not rest upon the conception in itself but upon the construction of it in space that is to say upon the conditions of space and its determinations
but these have themselves objective reality that is they apply to possible things because they contain priori the form of experience in general
and now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and influence of this postulate of possibility
when i represent to myself a thing that is permanent so that everything in it which changes belongs merely to its state or condition from such a conception alone i never can cognize that such a thing is possible
or if i represent to myself something which is so constituted that when it is posited something else follows always and infallibly my thought contains no selfcontradiction but whether such a property as causality is to be found in any possible thing my thought alone affords no means of judging
finally i can represent to myself different things substances which are so constituted that the state or condition of one causes a change in the state of the other and reciprocally but whether such a relation is a property of things cannot be perceived from these conceptions which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis
only from the fact therefore that these conceptions express priori the relations of perceptions in every experience do we know that they possess objective reality that is transcendental truth and that independent of experience though not independent of all relation to form of an experience in general and its synthetical unity in which alone objects can be empirically cognized
but when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances forces action and reaction from the material presented to us by perception without following the example of experience in their connection we create mere chimeras of the possibility of which we cannot discover any criterion because we have not taken experience for our instructress though we have borrowed the conceptions from her
such fictitious conceptions derive their character of possibility not like the categories priori as conceptions on which all experience depends but only posteriori as conceptions given by means of experience itself and their possibility must either be cognized posteriori and empirically or it cannot be cognized at all
a substance which is permanently present in space yet without filling it like that tertium quid between matter and the thinking subject which some have tried to introduce into metaphysics or a peculiar fundamental power of the mind of intuiting the future by anticipation instead of merely inferring from past and present events or finally a power of the mind to place itself in community of thought with other men however distant they may bethese are conceptions the possibility of which has no ground to rest upon
for they are not based upon experience and its known laws and without experience they are a merely arbitrary conjunction of thoughts which though containing no internal contradiction has no claim to objective reality neither consequently to the possibility of such an object as is thought in these conceptions
as far as concerns reality it is selfevident that we cannot cogitate such a possibility in concreto without the aid of experience because reality is concerned only with sensation as the matter of experience and not with the form of thought with which we can no doubt indulge in shaping fancies
but i pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in experience and i purpose treating here merely of the possibility of things by means of priori conceptions
i maintain then that the possibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se but only when considered as formal and objective conditions of an experience in general
it seems indeed as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized from the conception of it alone which is certainly independent of experience for we can certainly give to the conception a corresponding object completely priori that is to say we can construct it
but as a triangle is only the form of an object it must remain a mere product of the imagination and the possibility of the existence of an object corresponding to it must remain doubtful unless we can discover some other ground unless we know that the figure can be cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experience rest
now the facts that space is a formal condition priori of external experience that the formative synthesis by which we construct a triangle in imagination is the very same as that we employ in the apprehension of a phenomenon for the purpose of making an empirical conception of it are what alone connect the notion of the possibility of such a thing with the conception of it
in the same manner the possibility of continuous quantities indeed of quantities in general for the conceptions of them are without exception synthetical is never evident from the conceptions in themselves but only when they are considered as the formal conditions of the determination of objects in experience
and where indeed should we look for objects to correspond to our conceptions if not in experience by which alone objects are presented to us it is however true that without antecedent experience we can cognize and characterize the possibility of things relatively to the formal conditions under which something is determined in experience as an object consequently completely priori
but still this is possible only in relation to experience and within its limits
the postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of things requires perception consequently conscious sensation not indeed immediately that is of the object itself whose existence is to be cognized but still that the object have some connection with a real perception in accordance with the analogies of experience which exhibit all kinds of real connection in experience
from the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude its existence
for let the conception be ever so complete and containing a statement of all the determinations of the thing the existence of it has nothing to do with all this but only with thew question whether such a thing is given so that the perception of it can in every case precede the conception
for the fact that the conception of it precedes the perception merely indicates the possibility of its existence it is perception which presents matter to the conception that is the sole criterion of reality
prior to the perception of the thing however and therefore comparatively priori we are able to cognize its existence provided it stands in connection with some perceptions according to the principles of the empirical conjunction of these that is in conformity with the analogies of perception
for in this case the existence of the supposed thing is connected with our perception in a possible experience and we are able with the guidance of these analogies to reason in the series of possible perceptions from a thing which we do really perceive to the thing we do not perceive
thus we cognize the existence of a magnetic matter penetrating all bodies from the perception of the attraction of the steelfilings by the magnet although the constitution of our organs renders an immediate perception of this matter impossible for us
for according to the laws of sensibility and the connected context of our perceptions we should in an experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of this matter if our senses were more acutebut this obtuseness has no influence upon and cannot alter the form of possible experience in general
our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as our perceptions and what may be inferred from them according to empirical laws extend
if we do not set out from experience or do not proceed according to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena our pretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do not immediately perceive are vain
idealism however brings forward powerful objections to these rules for proving existence mediately
this is therefore the proper place for its refutation
refutation of idealism
idealismi mean material idealismis the theory which declares the existence of objects in space without us to be either doubtful and indemonstrable or false and impossible
the first is the problematical idealism of descartes who admits the undoubted certainty of only one empirical assertion assertio to wit i am
the second is the dogmatical idealism of berkeley who maintains that space together with all the objects of which it is the inseparable condition is a thing which is in itself impossible and that consequently the objects in space are mere products of the imagination
the dogmatical theory of idealism is unavoidable if we regard space as a property of things in themselves for in that case it is with all to which it serves as condition a nonentity
but the foundation for this kind of idealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental sthetic
problematical idealism which makes no such assertion but only alleges our incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves by means of immediate experience is a theory rational and evidencing a thorough and philosophical mode of thinking for it observes the rule not to form a decisive judgement before sufficient proof be shown
the desired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience of external things and not mere fancies
for this purpose we must prove that our internal and to descartes indubitable experience is itself possible only under the previous assumption of external experience
theorem
the simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence proves the existence of external objects in space
proof
i am conscious of my own existence as determined in time
all determination in regard to time presupposes the existence of something permanent in perception
but this permanent something cannot be something in me for the very reason that my existence in time is itself determined by this permanent something
it follows that the perception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thing without me and not through the mere representation of a thing without me
consequently the determination of my existence in time is possible only through the existence of real things external to me
now consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness of the possibility of this determination in time
hence it follows that consciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existence of things without me inasmuch as the existence of these things is the condition of determination in time
that is to say the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of the existence of other things without me
remark i
the reader will observe that in the foregoing proof the game which idealism plays is retorted upon itself and with more justice
it assumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that from this we can only infer the existence of external things
but as always happens when we reason from given effects to determined causes idealism has reasoned with too much haste and uncertainty for it is quite possible that the cause of our representations may lie in ourselves and that we ascribe it falsely to external things
but our proof shows that external experience is properly immediate that only by virtue of itnot indeed the consciousness of our own existence but certainly the determination of our existence in time that is internal experienceis possible
it is true that the representation i am which is the expression of the consciousness which can accompany all my thoughts is that which immediately includes the existence of a subject
but in this representation we cannot find any knowledge of the subject and therefore also no empirical knowledge that is experience
for experience contains in addition to the thought of something existing intuition and in this case it must be internal intuition that is time in relation to which the subject must be determined
but the existence of external things is absolutely requisite for this purpose so that it follows that internal experience is itself possible only mediately and through external experience
the immediate consciousness of the existence of external things is in the preceding theorem not presupposed but proved by the possibility of this consciousness understood by us or not
the question as to the possibility of it would stand thus have we an internal sense but no external sense and is our belief in external perception a mere delusion but it is evident that in order merely to fancy to ourselves anything as external that is to present it to the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense and must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an external intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act of imagination
for merely to imagine also an external sense would annihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined by the imagination
remark ii
now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of cognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance
its truth is supported by the fact that it is possible to perceive a determination of time only by means of a change in external relations motion to the permanent in space for example we become aware of the suns motion by observing the changes of his relation to the objects of this earth
but this is not all
we find that we possess nothing permanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of a substance as intuition except matter
this idea of permanence is not itself derived from external experience but is an priori necessary condition of all determination of time consequently also of the internal sense in reference to our own existence and that through the existence of external things
in the representation i the consciousness of myself is not an intuition but a merely intellectual representation produced by the spontaneous activity of a thinking subject
it follows that this i has not any predicate of intuition which in its character of permanence could serve as correlate to the determination of time in the internal sensein the same way as impenetrability is the correlate of matter as an empirical intuition
remark iii
from the fact that the existence of external things is a necessary condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness of ourselves it does not follow that every intuitive representation of external things involves the existence of these things for their representations may very well be the mere products of the imagination in dreams as well as in madness though indeed these are themselves created by the reproduction of previous external perceptions which as has been shown are possible only through the reality of external objects
the sole aim of our remarks has however been to prove that internal experience in general is possible only through external experience in general
whether this or that supposed experience be purely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinations and by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience
finally as regards the third postulate it applies to material necessity in existence and not to merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of conceptions
now as we cannot cognize completely priori the existence of any object of sense though we can do so comparatively priori that is relatively to some other previously given existencea cognition however which can only be of such an existence as must be contained in the complex of experience of which the previously given perception is a partthe necessity of existence can never be cognized from conceptions but always on the contrary from its connection with that which is an object of perception
but the only existence cognized under the condition of other given phenomena as necessary is the existence of effects from given causes in conformity with the laws of causality
it is consequently not the necessity of the existence of things as substances but the necessity of the state of things that we cognize and that not immediately but by means of the existence of other states given in perception according to empirical laws of causality
hence it follows that the criterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possible experiencethat everything which happens is determined priori in the phenomenon by its cause
thus we cognize only the necessity of effects in nature the causes of which are given us
moreover the criterion of necessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field of possible experience and even in this it is not valid of the existence of things as substances because these can never be considered as empirical effects or as something that happens and has a beginning
necessity therefore regards only the relations of phenomena according to the dynamical law of causality and the possibility grounded thereon of reasoning from some given existence of a cause priori to another existence of an effect
everything that happens is hypothetically necessary is a principle which subjects the changes that take place in the world to a law that is to a rule of necessary existence without which nature herself could not possibly exist
hence the proposition nothing happens by blind chance in mundo non datur casus is an priori law of nature
the case is the same with the proposition necessity in nature is not blind that is it is conditioned consequently intelligible necessity non datur fatum
both laws subject the play of change to a nature of things as phenomena or which is the same thing to the unity of the understanding and through the understanding alone can changes belong to an experience as the synthetical unity of phenomena
both belong to the class of dynamical principles
the former is properly a consequence of the principle of causalityone of the analogies of experience
the latter belongs to the principles of modality which to the determination of causality adds the conception of necessity which is itself however subject to a rule of the understanding
the principle of continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded as changes in mundo non datur saltus and likewise in the complex of all empirical intuitions in space any break or hiatus between two phenomena non datur hiatusfor we can so express the principle that experience can admit nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum or which even admits it as a part of an empirical synthesis
for as regards a vacuum or void which we may cogitate as out and beyond the field of possible experience the world such a question cannot come before the tribunal of mere understanding which decides only upon questions that concern the employment of given phenomena for the construction of empirical cognition
it is rather a problem for ideal reason which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and aims at forming a judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribes it and the proper place for the consideration of it is the transcendental dialectic
these four propositions in mundo non datur hiatus non datur saltus non datur casus non datur fatum as well as all principles of transcendental origin we could very easily exhibit in their proper order that is in conformity with the order of the categories and assign to each its proper place
but the already practised reader will do this for himself or discover the clue to such an arrangement
but the combined result of all is simply this to admit into the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or be foreign to the understanding and the continuous connection of all phenomena that is the unity of the conceptions of the understanding
for in the understanding alone is the unity of experience in which all perceptions must have their assigned place possible
whether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality and whether the field of the latter be itself greater than that of necessity are interesting enough questions and quite capable of synthetic solution questions however which come under the jurisdiction of reason alone
for they are tantamount to asking whether all things as phenomena do without exception belong to the complex and connected whole of a single experience of which every given perception is a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any other phenomenaor whether my perceptions can belong to more than one possible experience the understanding gives to experience according to the subjective and formal conditions of sensibility as well as of apperception the rules which alone make this experience possible
other forms of intuition besides those of space and time other forms of understanding besides the discursive forms of thought or of cognition by means of conceptions we can neither imagine nor make intelligible to ourselves and even if we could they would still not belong to experience which is the only mode of cognition by which objects are presented to us
whether other perceptions besides those which belong to the total of our possible experience and consequently whether some other sphere of matter exists the understanding has no power to decide its proper occupation being with the synthesis of that which is given
moreover the poverty of the usual arguments which go to prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility of which all that is real every object of experience is but a small part is very remarkable
all real is possible from this follows naturally according to the logical laws of conversion the particular proposition some possible is real
now this seems to be equivalent to much is possible that is not real
no doubt it does seem as if we ought to consider the sum of the possible to be greater than that of the real from the fact that something must be added to the former to constitute the latter
but this notion of adding to the possible is absurd
for that which is not in the sum of the possible and consequently requires to be added to it is manifestly impossible
in addition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience the understanding requires a connection with some perception but that which is connected with this perception is real even although it is not immediately perceived
but that another series of phenomena in complete coherence with that which is given in perception consequently more than one allembracing experience is possible is an inference which cannot be concluded from the data given us by experience and still less without any data at all
that which is possible only under conditions which are themselves merely possible is not possible in any respect
and yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base the discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is wider than that of experience
i have merely mentioned these questions that in treating of the conception of the understanding there might be no omission of anything that in the common opinion belongs to them
in reality however the notion of absolute possibility possibility which is valid in every respect is not a mere conception of the understanding which can be employed empirically but belongs to reason alone which passes the bounds of all empirical use of the understanding
we have therefore contented ourselves with a merely critical remark leaving the subject to be explained in the sequel
before concluding this fourth section and at the same time the system of all principles of the pure understanding it seems proper to mention the reasons which induced me to term the principles of modality postulates
this expression i do not here use in the sense which some more recent philosophers contrary to its meaning with mathematicians to whom the word properly belongs attach to itthat of a proposition namely immediately certain requiring neither deduction nor proof
for if in the case of synthetical propositions however evident they may be we accord to them without deduction and merely on the strength of their own pretensions unqualified belief all critique of the understanding is entirely lost and as there is no want of bold pretensions which the common belief though for the philosopher this is no credential does not reject the understanding lies exposed to every delusion and conceit without the power of refusing its assent to those assertions which though illegitimate demand acceptance as veritable axioms
when therefore to the conception of a thing an priori determination is synthetically added such a proposition must obtain if not a proof at least a deduction of the legitimacy of its assertion
the principles of modality are however not objectively synthetical for the predicates of possibility reality and necessity do not in the least augment the conception of that of which they are affirmed inasmuch as they contribute nothing to the representation of the object
but as they are nevertheless always synthetical they are so merely subjectively
that is to say they have a reflective power and apply to the conception of a thing of which in other respects they affirm nothing the faculty of cognition in which the conception originates and has its seat
so that if the conception merely agree with the formal conditions of experience its object is called possible if it is in connection with perception and determined thereby the object is real if it is determined according to conceptions by means of the connection of perceptions the object is called necessary
the principles of modality therefore predicate of a conception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognition which generated it
now a postulate in mathematics is a practical proposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which we present an object to ourselves and produce the conception of it for examplewith a given line to describe a circle upon a plane from a given point and such a proposition does not admit of proof because the procedure which it requires is exactly that by which alone it is possible to generate the conception of such a figure
with the same right accordingly can we postulate the principles of modality because they do not augment the conception of a thing but merely indicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of cognition
when i think the reality of a thing i do really think more than the possibility but not in the thing for that can never contain more in reality than was contained in its complete possibility
but while the notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing in relation to the understanding its empirical use reality is the conjunction of the thing with perception
general remark on the system of principles
it is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a thing from the category alone but must always have an intuition by which to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception of the understanding
take for example the categories of relation
how a thing can exist only as a subject and not as a mere determination of other things that is can be substance or how because something exists some other thing must exist consequently how a thing can be a cause or how when several things exist from the fact that one of these things exists some consequence to the others follows and reciprocally and in this way a community of substances can be possibleare questions whose solution cannot be obtained from mere conceptions
the very same is the case with the other categories for example how a thing can be of the same sort with many others that is can be a quantity and so on
so long as we have not intuition we cannot know whether we do really think an object by the categories and where an object can anywhere be found to cohere with them and thus the truth is established that the categories are not in themselves cognitions but mere forms of thought for the construction of cognitions from given intuitions
for the same reason is it true that from categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made
for example in every existence there is substance that is something that can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate or everything is a quantityto construct propositions such as these we require something to enable us to go out beyond the given conception and connect another with it
for the same reason the attempt to prove a synthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions for example everything that exists contingently has a cause has never succeeded
we could never get further than proving that without this relation to conceptions we could not conceive the existence of the contingent that is could not priori through the understanding cognize the existence of such a thing but it does not hence follow that this is also the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said to be contingent
if accordingly we look back to our proof of the principle of causality we shall find that we were able to prove it as valid only of objects of possible experience and indeed only as itself the principle of the possibility of experience consequently of the cognition of an object given in empirical intuition and not from mere conceptions
that however the proposition everything that is contingent must have a cause is evident to every one merely from conceptions is not to be denied
but in this case the conception of the contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality as that the nonexistence of which can be conceived but that of relation as that which can exist only as the consequence of something else and so it is really an identical proposition that which can exist only as a consequence has a cause
in fact when we have to give examples of contingent existence we always refer to changes and not merely to the possibility of conceiving the opposite
but change is an event which as such is possible only through a cause and considered per se its nonexistence is therefore possible and we become cognizant of its contingency from the fact that it can exist only as the effect of a cause
hence if a thing is assumed to be contingent it is an analytical proposition to say it has a cause
we can easily conceive the nonexistence of matter but the ancients did not thence infer its contingency
but even the alternation of the existence and nonexistence of a given state in a thing in which all change consists by no means proves the contingency of that statethe ground of proof being the reality of its opposite
for example a body is in a state of rest after motion but we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the former is the opposite of the latter
for this opposite is merely a logical and not a real opposite to the other
if we wish to demonstrate the contingency of the motion what we ought to prove is that instead of the motion which took place in the preceding point of time it was possible for the body to have been then in rest not that it is afterwards in rest for in this case both opposites are perfectly consistent with each other
but it is still more remarkable that to understand the possibility of things according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the objective reality of the latter we require not merely intuitions but external intuitions
if for example we take the pure conceptions of relation we find that for the purpose of presenting to the conception of substance something permanent in intuition corresponding thereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality of this conception we require an intuition of matter in space because space alone is permanent and determines things as such while time and with it all that is in the internal sense is in a state of continual flow in order to represent change as the intuition corresponding to the conception of causality we require the representation of motion as change in space in fact it is through it alone that changes the possibility of which no pure understanding can perceive are capable of being intuited
change is the connection of determinations contradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and the same thing
now how it is possible that out of a given state one quite opposite to it in the same thing should follow reason without an example can not only not conceive but cannot even make intelligible without intuition and this intuition is the motion of a point in space the existence of which in different spaces as a consequence of opposite determinations alone makes the intuition of change possible
for in order to make even internal change cognitable we require to represent time as the form of the internal sense figuratively by a line and the internal change by the drawing of that line motion and consequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able to represent the successive existence of ourselves in different states
the proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as change presupposes something permanent in intuition while in the internal sense no permanent intuition is to be found
lastly the objective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceived by mere reason and consequently its objective reality cannot be demonstrated without an intuition and that external in space
for how can we conceive the possibility of community that is when several substances exist that some effect on the existence of the one follows from the existence of the other and reciprocally and therefore that because something exists in the latter something else must exist in the former which could not be understood from its own existence alone for this is the very essence of communitywhich is inconceivable as a property of things which are perfectly isolated
hence leibnitz in attributing to the substances of the worldas cogitated by the understanding alonea community required the mediating aid of a divinity for from their existence such a property seemed to him with justice inconceivable
but we can very easily conceive the possibility of community of substances as phenomena if we represent them to ourselves as in space consequently in external intuition
for external intuition contains in itself priori formal external relations as the conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and reaction and therefore of the possibility of community
with the same ease can it be demonstrated that the possibility of things as quantities and consequently the objective reality of the category of quantity can be grounded only in external intuition and that by its means alone is the notion of quantity appropriated by the internal sense
but i must avoid prolixity and leave the task of illustrating this by examples to the readers own reflection
the above remarks are of the greatest importance not only for the confirmation of our previous confutation of idealism but still more when the subject of selfcognition by mere internal consciousness and the determination of our own nature without the aid of external empirical intuitions is under discussion for the indication of the grounds of the possibility of such a cognition
the result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is therefore all principles of the pure understanding are nothing more than priori principles of the possibility of experience and to experience alone do all priori synthetical propositions apply and relate indeed their possibility itself rests entirely on this relation
chapter iii of the ground of the division of all objects into phenomena and noumena
we have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and carefully surveyed every part of it but we have also measured it and assigned to everything therein its proper place
but this land is an island and enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits
it is the land of truth an attractive word surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean the region of illusion where many a fogbank many an iceberg seems to the mariner on his voyage of discovery a new country and while constantly deluding him with vain hopes engages him in dangerous adventures from which he never can desist and which yet he never can bring to a termination
but before venturing upon this sea in order to explore it in its whole extent and to arrive at a certainty whether anything is to be discovered there it will not be without advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land that we are about to leave and to ask ourselves firstly whether we cannot rest perfectly contented with what it contains or whether we must not of necessity be contented with it if we can find nowhere else a solid foundation to build upon and secondly by what title we possess this land itself and how we hold it secure against all hostile claims although in the course of our analytic we have already given sufficient answers to these questions yet a summary recapitulation of these solutions may be useful in strengthening our conviction by uniting in one point the momenta of the arguments
we have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself without borrowing from experience it nevertheless possesses only for the behoof and use of experience
the principles of the pure understanding whether constitutive priori as the mathematical principles or merely regulative as the dynamical contain nothing but the pure schema as it were of possible experience
for experience possesses its unity from the synthetical unity which the understanding originally and from itself imparts to the synthesis of the imagination in relation to apperception and in priori relation to and agreement with which phenomena as data for a possible cognition must stand
but although these rules of the understanding are not only priori true but the very source of all truth that is of the accordance of our cognition with objects and on this ground that they contain the basis of the possibility of experience as the ensemble of all cognition it seems to us not enough to propound what is truewe desire also to be told what we want to know
if then we learn nothing more by this critical examination than what we should have practised in the merely empirical use of the understanding without any such subtle inquiry the presumption is that the advantage we reap from it is not worth the labour bestowed upon it
it may certainly be answered that no rash curiosity is more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge than that which must know beforehand the utility of this or that piece of information which we seek before we have entered on the needful investigations and before one could form the least conception of its utility even though it were placed before our eyes
but there is one advantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be made comprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learnerthis namely that the understanding which is occupied merely with empirical exercise and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition may exercise its functions very well and very successfully but is quite unable to do one thing and that of very great importance to determine namely the bounds that limit its employment and to know what lies within or without its own sphere
this purpose can be obtained only by such profound investigations as we have instituted
but if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its horizon or not it can never be sure either as to its claims or possessions but must lay its account with many humiliating corrections when it transgresses as it unavoidably will the limits of its own territory and loses itself in fanciful opinions and blinding illusions
that the understanding therefore cannot make of its priori principles or even of its conceptions other than an empirical use is a proposition which leads to the most important results
a transcendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental proposition or principle when it is referred to things in general and considered as things in themselves an empirical use when it is referred merely to phenomena that is to objects of a possible experience
that the latter use of a conception is the only admissible one is evident from the reasons following
for every conception are requisite firstly the logical form of a conception of thought general and secondly the possibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply
failing this latter it has no sense and utterly void of content although it may contain the logical function for constructing a conception from certain data
now object cannot be given to a conception otherwise than by intuition and even if a pure intuition antecedent to the object is priori possible this pure intuition can itself obtain objective validity only from empirical intuition of which it is itself but the form
all conceptions therefore and with them all principles however high the degree of their priori possibility relate to empirical intuitions that is to data towards a possible experience
without this they possess no objective validity but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or notions
let us take for example the conceptions of mathematics and first in its pure intuitions
space has three dimensionsbetween two points there can be only one straight line etc
although all these principles and the representation of the object with which this science occupies itself are generated in the mind entirely priori they would nevertheless have no significance if we were not always able to exhibit their significance in and by means of phenomena empirical objects
hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be made sensuous that is that an object corresponding to it in intuition be forthcoming otherwise the conception remains as we say without sense that is without meaning
mathematics fulfils this requirement by the construction of the figure which is a phenomenon evident to the senses
the same science finds support and significance in number this in its turn finds it in the fingers or in counters or in lines and points
the conception itself is always produced priori together with the synthetical principles or formulas from such conceptions but the proper employment of them and their application to objects can exist nowhere but in experience the possibility of which as regards its form they contain priori
that this is also the case with all of the categories and the principles based upon them is evident from the fact that we cannot render intelligible the possibility of an object corresponding to them without having recourse to the conditions of sensibility consequently to the form of phenomena to which as their only proper objects their use must therefore be confined inasmuch as if this condition is removed all significance that is all relation to an object disappears and no example can be found to make it comprehensible what sort of things we ought to think under such conceptions
the conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it is the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many times one is placed in it
but this how many times is based upon successive repetition consequently upon time and the synthesis of the homogeneous therein
reality in contradistinction to negation can be explained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or is void
if i leave out the notion of permanence which is existence in all time there remains in the conception of substance nothing but the logical notion of subject a notion of which i endeavour to realize by representing to myself something that can exist only as a subject
but not only am i perfectly ignorant of any conditions under which this logical prerogative can belong to a thing i can make nothing out of the notion and draw no inference from it because no object to which to apply the conception is determined and we consequently do not know whether it has any meaning at all
in like manner if i leave out the notion of time in which something follows upon some other thing in conformity with a rule i can find nothing in the pure category except that there is a something of such a sort that from it a conclusion may be drawn as to the existence of some other thing
but in this case it would not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause and an effect but as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions of which i am quite ignorant the conception is not determined as to the mode in which it ought to apply to an object
the socalled principle everything that is contingent has a cause comes with a gravity and selfassumed authority that seems to require no support from without
but i ask what is meant by contingent the answer is that the nonexistence of which is possible
but i should like very well to know by what means this possibility of nonexistence is to be cognized if we do not represent to ourselves a succession in the series of phenomena and in this succession an existence which follows a nonexistence or conversely consequently change
for to say that the nonexistence of a thing is not selfcontradictory is a lame appeal to a logical condition which is no doubt a necessary condition of the existence of the conception but is far from being sufficient for the real objective possibility of nonexistence
i can annihilate in thought every existing substance without selfcontradiction but i cannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence that is to say the possibility of their nonexistence in itself
as regards the category of community it may easily be inferred that as the pure categories of substance and causality are incapable of a definition and explanation sufficient to determine their object without the aid of intuition the category of reciprocal causality in the relation of substances to each other commercium is just as little susceptible thereof
possibility existence and necessity nobody has ever yet been able to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology when the definition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding
for the substitution of the logical possibility of the conceptionthe condition of which is that it be not selfcontradictory for the transcendental possibility of thingsthe condition of which is that there be an object corresponding to the conception is a trick which can only deceive the inexperienced
in one word to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding object and consequently their real possibility cannot be demonstrated if we take away sensuous intuitionthe only intuition which we possessand there then remains nothing but the logical possibility that is the fact that the conception or thought is possiblewhich however is not the question what we want to know being whether it relates to an object and thus possesses any meaning
it follows incontestably that the pure conceptions of the understanding are incapable of transcendental and must always be of empirical use alone and that the principles of the pure understanding relate only to the general conditions of a possible experience to objects of the senses and never to things in general apart from the mode in which we intuite them
transcendental analytic has accordingly this important result to wit that the understanding is competent effect nothing priori except the anticipation of the form of a possible experience in general and that as that which is not phenomenon cannot be an object of experience it can never overstep the limits of sensibility within which alone objects are presented to us
its principles are merely principles of the exposition of phenomena and the proud name of an ontology which professes to present synthetical cognitions priori of things in general in a systematic doctrine must give place to the modest title of analytic of the pure understanding
thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object
if the mode of this intuition is unknown to us the object is merely transcendental and the conception of the understanding is employed only transcendentally that is to produce unity in the thought of a manifold in general
now a pure category in which all conditions of sensuous intuitionas the only intuition we possessare abstracted does not determine an object but merely expresses the thought of an object in general according to different modes
now to employ a conception the function of judgement is required by which an object is subsumed under the conception consequently the at least formal condition under which something can be given in intuition
failing this condition of judgement schema subsumption is impossible for there is in such a case nothing given which may be subsumed under the conception
the merely transcendental use of the categories is therefore in fact no use at all and has no determined or even as regards its form determinable object
hence it follows that the pure category is incompetent to establish a synthetical priori principle and that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empirical and never of transcendental use and that beyond the sphere of possible experience no synthetical priori principles are possible
it may be advisable therefore to express ourselves thus
the pure categories apart from the formal conditions of sensibility have a merely transcendental meaning but are nevertheless not of transcendental use because this is in itself impossible inasmuch as all the conditions of any employment or use of them in judgements are absent to wit the formal conditions of the subsumption of an object under these conceptions
as therefore in the character of pure categories they must be employed empirically and cannot be employed transcendentally they are of no use at all when separated from sensibility that is they cannot be applied to an object
they are merely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect of objects in general and of thought without its being at the same time possible to think or to determine any object by their means
but there lurks at the foundation of this subject an illusion which it is very difficult to avoid
the categories are not based as regards their origin upon sensibility like the forms of intuition space and time they seem therefore to be capable of an application beyond the sphere of sensuous objects
but this is not the case
they are nothing but mere forms of thought which contain only the logical faculty of uniting priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition
apart then from the only intuition possible for us they have still less meaning than the pure sensuous forms space and time for through them an object is at least given while a mode of connection of the manifold when the intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting has no meaning at all
at the same time when we designate certain objects as phenomena or sensuous existences thus distinguishing our mode of intuiting them from their own nature as things in themselves it is evident that by this very distinction we as it were place the latter considered in this their own nature although we do not so intuite them in opposition to the former or on the other hand we do so place other possible things which are not objects of our senses but are cogitated by the understanding alone and call them intelligible existences noumena
now the question arises whether the pure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance in respect of these latter and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them
but we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity which may easily occasion great misapprehension
the understanding when it terms an object in a certain relation phenomenon at the same time forms out of this relation a representation or notion of an object in itself and hence believes that it can form also conceptions of such objects
now as the understanding possesses no other fundamental conceptions besides the categories it takes for granted that an object considered as a thing in itself must be capable of being thought by means of these pure conceptions and is thereby led to hold the perfectly undetermined conception of an intelligible existence a something out of the sphere of our sensibility for a determinate conception of an existence which we can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding
if by the term noumenon we understand a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensuous intuition thus making abstraction of our mode of intuiting it this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word
but if we understand by it an object of a nonsensuous intuition we in this case assume a peculiar mode of intuition an intellectual intuition to wit which does not however belong to us of the very possibility of which we have no notionand this is a noumenon in the positive sense
the doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in the negative sense that is of things which the understanding is obliged to cogitate apart from any relation to our mode of intuition consequently not as mere phenomena but as things in themselves
but the understanding at the same time comprehends that it cannot employ its categories for the consideration of things in themselves because these possess significance only in relation to the unity of intuitions in space and time and that they are competent to determine this unity by means of general priori connecting conceptions only on account of the pure ideality of space and time
where this unity of time is not to be met with as is the case with noumena the whole use indeed the whole meaning of the categories is entirely lost for even the possibility of things to correspond to the categories is in this case incomprehensible
on this point i need only refer the reader to what i have said at the commencement of the general remark appended to the foregoing chapter
now the possibility of a thing can never be proved from the fact that the conception of it is not selfcontradictory but only by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception
if therefore we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot be regarded as phenomena we must have an intuition different from the sensuous and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the positive sense of the word
now as such an intuition that is an intellectual intuition is no part of our faculty of cognition it is absolutely impossible for the categories to possess any application beyond the limits of experience
it may be true that there are intelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous intuition has no relation and cannot be applied but our conceptions of the understanding as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition do not extend to these
what therefore we call noumenon must be understood by us as such in a negative sense
if i take away from an empirical intuition all thought by means of the categories there remains no cognition of any object for by means of mere intuition nothing is cogitated and from the existence of such or such an affection of sensibility in me it does not follow that this affection or representation has any relation to an object without me
but if i take away all intuition there still remains the form of thought that is the mode of determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition
thus the categories do in some measure really extend further than sensuous intuition inasmuch as they think objects in general without regard to the mode of sensibility in which these objects are given
but they do not for this reason apply to and determine a wider sphere of objects because we cannot assume that such can be given without presupposing the possibility of another than the sensuous mode of intuition a supposition we are not justified in making
i call a conception problematical which contains in itself no contradiction and which is connected with other cognitions as a limitation of given conceptions but whose objective reality cannot be cognized in any manner
the conception of a noumenon that is of a thing which must be cogitated not as an object of sense but as a thing in itself solely through the pure understanding is not selfcontradictory for we are not entitled to maintain that sensibility is the only possible mode of intuition
nay further this conception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the bounds of phenomena and thus to limit the objective validity of sensuous cognition for things in themselves which lie beyond its province are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating that this cognition does not extend its application to all that the understanding thinks
but after all the possibility of such noumena is quite incomprehensible and beyond the sphere of phenomena all is for us a mere void that is to say we possess an understanding whose province does problematically extend beyond this sphere but we do not possess an intuition indeed not even the conception of a possible intuition by means of which objects beyond the region of sensibility could be given us and in reference to which the understanding might be employed assertorically
the conception of a noumenon is therefore merely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use
but it is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion but is connected with the limitation of sensibility without however being capable of presenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere
the division of objects into phenomena and noumena and of the world into a mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quite inadmissible in a positive sense although conceptions do certainly admit of such a division for the class of noumena have no determinate object corresponding to them and cannot therefore possess objective validity
if we abandon the senses how can it be made conceivable that the categories which are the only conceptions that could serve as conceptions for noumena have any sense or meaning at all inasmuch as something more than the mere unity of thought namely a possible intuition is requisite for their application to an object the conception of a noumenon considered as merely problematical is however not only admissible but as a limitative conception of sensibility absolutely necessary
but in this case a noumenon is not a particular intelligible object for our understanding on the contrary the kind of understanding to which it could belong is itself a problem for we cannot form the most distant conception of the possibility of an understanding which should cognize an object not discursively by means of categories but intuitively in a nonsensuous intuition
our understanding attains in this way a sort of negative extension
that is to say it is not limited by but rather limits sensibility by giving the name of noumena to things not considered as phenomena but as things in themselves
but it at the same time prescribes limits to itself for it confesses itself unable to cognize these by means of the categories and hence is compelled to cogitate them merely as an unknown something
i find however in the writings of modern authors an entirely different use of the expressions mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis which quite departs from the meaning of the ancientsan acceptation in which indeed there is to be found no difficulty but which at the same time depends on mere verbal quibbling
according to this meaning some have chosen to call the complex of phenomena in so far as it is intuited mundus sensibilis but in so far as the connection thereof is cogitated according to general laws of thought mundus intelligibilis
astronomy in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of the starry heaven may represent the former a system of astronomy such as the copernican or newtonian the latter
but such twisting of words is a mere sophistical subterfuge to avoid a difficult question by modifying its meaning to suit our own convenience
to be sure understanding and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena but the question is whether these can be applied when the object is not a phenomenon and in this sense we regard it if it is cogitated as given to the understanding alone and not to the senses
the question therefore is whether over and above the empirical use of the understanding a transcendental use is possible which applies to the noumenon as an object
this question we have answered in the negative
when therefore we say the senses represent objects as they appear the understanding as they are the latter statement must not be understood in a transcendental but only in an empirical signification that is as they must be represented in the complete connection of phenomena and not according to what they may be apart from their relation to possible experience consequently not as objects of the pure understanding
for this must ever remain unknown to us
nay it is also quite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinary cognition is possible under any circumstances at least whether it is possible by means of our categories
understanding and sensibility with us can determine objects only in conjunction
if we separate them we have intuitions without conceptions or conceptions without intuitions in both cases representations which we cannot apply to any determinate object
if after all our inquiries and explanations any one still hesitates to abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories let him attempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition
it would of course be unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analytical proposition for that does not extend the sphere of the understanding but being concerned only about what is cogitated in the conception itself it leaves it quite undecided whether the conception has any relation to objects or merely indicates the unity of thoughtcomplete abstraction being made of the modi in which an object may be given in such a proposition it is sufficient for the understanding to know what lies in the conceptionto what it applies is to it indifferent
the attempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and socalled transcendental principle for example everything that exists exists as substance or everything that is contingent exists as an effect of some other thing viz
of its cause
now i ask whence can the understanding draw these synthetical propositions when the conceptions contained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things in themselves noumena where is to be found the third term which is always requisite pure site in a synthetical proposition which may connect in the same proposition conceptions which have no logical analytical connection with each other the proposition never will be demonstrated nay more the possibility of any such pure assertion never can be shown without making reference to the empirical use of the understanding and thus ipso facto completely renouncing pure and nonsensuous judgement
thus the conception of pure and merely intelligible objects is completely void of all principles of its application because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might be given and the problematical thought which leaves a place open for them serves only like a void space to limit the use of empirical principles without containing at the same time any other object of cognition beyond their sphere
appendix
of the equivocal nature or amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection from the confusion of the transcendental with the empirical use of the understanding
reflection reflexio is not occupied about objects themselves for the purpose of directly obtaining conceptions of them but is that state of the mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjective conditions under which we obtain conceptions
it is the consciousness of the relation of given representations to the different sources or faculties of cognition by which alone their relation to each other can be rightly determined
the first question which occurs in considering our representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong to the understanding or to the senses many judgements are admitted to be true from mere habit or inclination but because reflection neither precedes nor follows it is held to be a judgement that has its origin in the understanding
all judgements do not require examination that is investigation into the grounds of their truth
for when they are immediately certain for example between two points there can be only one straight line no better or less mediate test of their truth can be found than that which they themselves contain and express
but all judgement nay all comparisons require reflection that is a distinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong
the act whereby i compare my representations with the faculty of cognition which originates them and whereby i distinguish whether they are compared with each other as belonging to the pure understanding or to sensuous intuition i term transcendental reflection
now the relations in which conceptions can stand to each other are those of identity and difference agreement and opposition of the internal and external finally of the determinable and the determining matter and form
the proper determination of these relations rests on the question to what faculty of cognition they subjectively belong whether to sensibility or understanding for on the manner in which we solve this question depends the manner in which we must cogitate these relations
before constructing any objective judgement we compare the conceptions that are to be placed in the judgement and observe whether there exists identity of many representations in one conception if a general judgement is to be constructed or difference if a particular whether there is agreement when affirmative and opposition when negative judgements are to be constructed and so on
for this reason we ought to call these conceptions conceptions of comparison conceptus comparationis
but as when the question is not as to the logical form but as to the content of conceptions that is to say whether the things themselves are identical or different in agreement or opposition and so on the things can have a twofold relation to our faculty of cognition to wit a relation either to sensibility or to the understanding and as on this relation depends their relation to each other transcendental reflection that is the relation of given representations to one or the other faculty of cognition can alone determine this latter relation
thus we shall not be able to discover whether the things are identical or different in agreement or opposition etc
from the mere conception of the things by means of comparison comparatio but only by distinguishing the mode of cognition to which they belong in other words by means of transcendental reflection
we may therefore with justice say that logical reflection is mere comparison for in it no account is taken of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong and they are consequently as far as regards their origin to be treated as homogeneous while transcendental reflection which applies to the objects themselves contains the ground of the possibility of objective comparison of representations with each other and is therefore very different from the former because the faculties of cognition to which they belong are not even the same
transcendental reflection is a duty which no one can neglect who wishes to establish an priori judgement upon things
we shall now proceed to fulfil this duty and thereby throw not a little light on the question as to the determination of the proper business of the understanding
identity and difference
when an object is presented to us several times but always with the same internal determinations qualitas et quantitas it if an object of pure understanding is always the same not several things but only one thing numerica identitas but if a phenomenon we do not concern ourselves with comparing the conception of the thing with the conception of some other but although they may be in this respect perfectly the same the difference of place at the same time is a sufficient ground for asserting the numerical difference of these objects of sense
thus in the case of two drops of water we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference quality and quantity and the fact that they are intuited at the same time in different places is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be numerically different
leibnitz regarded phenomena as things in themselves consequently as intelligibilia that is objects of pure understanding although on account of the confused nature of their representations he gave them the name of phenomena and in this case his principle of the indiscernible principium identatis indiscernibilium is not to be impugned
but as phenomena are objects of sensibility and as the understanding in respect of them must be employed empirically and not purely or transcendentally plurality and numerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of external phenomena
for one part of space although it may be perfectly similar and equal to another part is still without it and for this reason alone is different from the latter which is added to it in order to make up a greater space
it follows that this must hold good of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same time however similar and equal one may be to another
agreement and opposition
when reality is represented by the pure understanding realitas noumenon opposition between realities is incogitablesuch a relation that is that when these realities are connected in one subject they annihilate the effects of each other and may be represented in the formula
on the other hand the real in a phenomenon realitas phaenomenon may very well be in mutual opposition and when united in the same subject the one may completely or in part annihilate the effect or consequence of the other as in the case of two moving forces in the same straight line drawing or impelling a point in opposite directions or in the case of a pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain
the internal and external
in an object of the pure understanding only that is internal which has no relation as regards its existence to anything different from itself
on the other hand the internal determinations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but relations and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mere relations
substance in space we are cognizant of only through forces operative in it either drawing others towards itself attraction or preventing others from forcing into itself repulsion and impenetrability
we know no other properties that make up the conception of substance phenomenal in space and which we term matter
on the other hand as an object of the pure understanding every substance must have internal determination and forces
but what other internal attributes of such an object can i think than those which my internal sense presents to me that to wit which in either itself thought or something analogous to it
hence leibnitz who looked upon things as noumena after denying them everything like external relation and therefore also composition or combination declared that all substances even the component parts of matter were simple substances with powers of representation in one word monads
matter and form
these two conceptions lie at the foundation of all other reflection so inseparably are they connected with every mode of exercising the understanding
the former denotes the determinable in general the second its determination both in a transcendental sense abstraction being made of every difference in that which is given and of the mode in which it is determined
logicians formerly termed the universal matter the specific difference of this or that part of the universal form
in a judgement one may call the given conceptions logical matter for the judgement the relation of these to each other by means of the copula the form of the judgement
in an object the composite parts thereof essentialia are the matter the mode in which they are connected in the object the form
in respect to things in general unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all possibility the limitation thereof negation as the form by which one thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental conceptions
the understanding demands that something be given at least in the conception in order to be able to determine it in a certain manner
hence in a conception of the pure understanding the matter precedes the form and for this reason leibnitz first assumed the existence of things monads and of an internal power of representation in them in order to found upon this their external relation and the community their state that is of their representations
hence with him space and time were possiblethe former through the relation of substances the latter through the connection of their determinations with each other as causes and effects
and so would it really be if the pure understanding were capable of an immediate application to objects and if space and time were determinations of things in themselves
but being merely sensuous intuitions in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena the form of intuition as a subjective property of sensibility must antecede all matter sensations consequently space and time must antecede all phenomena and all data of experience and rather make experience itself possible
but the intellectual philosopher could not endure that the form should precede the things themselves and determine their possibility an objection perfectly correct if we assume that we intuite things as they are although with confused representation
but as sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective condition which is priori at the foundation of all perception and the form of which is primitive the form must be given per se and so far from matter or the things themselves which appear lying at the foundation of experience as we must conclude if we judge by mere conceptions the very possibility of itself presupposes on the contrary a given formal intuition space and time
remark on the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection
let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception either in the sensibility or in the pure understanding the transcendental place
in this manner the appointment of the position which must be taken by each conception according to the difference in its use and the directions for determining this place to all conceptions according to rules would be a transcendental topic a doctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the surreptitious devices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence arise as it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition each conception properly belonged
every conception every title under which many cognitions rank together may be called a logical place
upon this is based the logical topic of aristotle of which teachers and rhetoricians could avail themselves in order under certain titles of thought to observe what would best suit the matter they had to treat and thus enable themselves to quibble and talk with fluency and an appearance of profundity
transcendental topic on the contrary contains nothing more than the abovementioned four titles of all comparison and distinction which differ from categories in this respect that they do not represent the object according to that which constitutes its conception quantity reality but set forth merely the comparison of representations which precedes our conceptions of things
but this comparison requires a previous reflection that is a determination of the place to which the representations of the things which are compared belong whether to wit they are cogitated by the pure understanding or given by sensibility
conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring to what faculty their objects belong whether as noumena to the understanding or as phenomena to sensibility
if however we wish to employ these conceptions in respect of objects previous transcendental reflection is necessary
without this reflection i should make a very unsafe use of these conceptions and construct pretended synthetical propositions which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which are based solely upon a transcendental amphiboly that is upon a substitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon
for want of this doctrine of transcendental topic and consequently deceived by the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection the celebrated leibnitz constructed an intellectual system of the world or rather believed himself competent to cognize the internal nature of things by comparing all objects merely with the understanding and the abstract formal conceptions of thought
our table of the conceptions of reflection gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibit the distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its parts and at the same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this peculiar mode of thought which rested upon naught but a misconception
he compared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions and naturally found no other differences than those by which the understanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another
the conditions of sensuous intuition which contain in themselves their own means of distinction he did not look upon as primitive because sensibility was to him but a confused mode of representation and not any particular source of representations
a phenomenon was for him the representation of the thing in itself although distinguished from cognition by the understanding only in respect of the logical formthe former with its usual want of analysis containing according to him a certain mixture of collateral representations in its conception of a thing which it is the duty of the understanding to separate and distinguish
in one word leibnitz intellectualized phenomena just as locke in his system of noogony if i may be allowed to make use of such expressions sensualized the conceptions of the understanding that is to say declared them to be nothing more than empirical or abstract conceptions of reflection
instead of seeking in the understanding and sensibility two different sources of representations which however can present us with objective judgements of things only in conjunction each of these great men recognized but one of these faculties which in their opinion applied immediately to things in themselves the other having no duty but that of confusing or arranging the representations of the former
accordingly the objects of sense were compared by leibnitz as things in general merely in the understanding
st
he compares them in regard to their identity or differenceas judged by the understanding
as therefore he considered merely the conceptions of objects and not their position in intuition in which alone objects can be given and left quite out of sight the transcendental locale of these conceptionswhether that is their object ought to be classed among phenomena or among things in themselves it was to be expected that he should extend the application of the principle of indiscernibles which is valid solely of conceptions of things in general to objects of sense mundus phaenomenon and that he should believe that he had thereby contributed in no small degree to extend our knowledge of nature
in truth if i cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water as a thing in itself i cannot look upon one drop as different from another if the conception of the one is completely identical with that of the other
but if it is a phenomenon in space it has a place not merely in the understanding among conceptions but also in sensuous external intuition in space and in this case the physical locale is a matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations of things and one place b may contain a thing which is perfectly similar and equal to another in a place a just as well as if the two things were in every respect different from each other
difference of place without any other conditions makes the plurality and distinction of objects as phenomena not only possible in itself but even necessary
consequently the above socalled law is not a law of nature
it is merely an analytical rule for the comparison of things by means of mere conceptions
nd
the principle realities as simple affirmations never logically contradict each other is a proposition perfectly true respecting the relation of conceptions but whether as regards nature or things in themselves of which we have not the slightest conception is without any the least meaning
for real opposition in which a b is exists everywhere an opposition that is in which one reality united with another in the same subject annihilates the effects of the othera fact which is constantly brought before our eyes by the different antagonistic actions and operations in nature which nevertheless as depending on real forces must be called realitates phaenomena
general mechanics can even present us with the empirical condition of this opposition in an priori rule as it directs its attention to the opposition in the direction of forcesa condition of which the transcendental conception of reality can tell us nothing
although m
leibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a new principle he yet employed it for the establishment of new propositions and his followers introduced it into their leibnitziowolfian system of philosophy
according to this principle for example all evils are but consequences of the limited nature of created beings that is negations because these are the only opposite of reality
in the mere conception of a thing in general this is really the case but not in things as phenomena
in like manner the upholders of this system deem it not only possible but natural also to connect and unite all reality in one being because they acknowledge no other sort of opposition than that of contradiction by which the conception itself of a thing is annihilated and find themselves unable to conceive an opposition of reciprocal destruction so to speak in which one real cause destroys the effect of another and the conditions of whose representation we meet with only in sensibility
rd
the leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on this philosophers mode of falsely representing the difference of the internal and external solely in relation to the understanding
substances in general must have something inward which is therefore free from external relations consequently from that of composition also
the simplethat which can be represented by a unitis therefore the foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves
the internal state of substances cannot therefore consist in place shape contact or motion determinations which are all external relations and we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby we internally determine our faculty of sense itself that is to say the state of representation
thus then were constructed the monads which were to form the elements of the universe the active force of which consists in representation the effects of this force being thus entirely confined to themselves
for the same reason his view of the possible community of substances could not represent it but as a predetermined harmony and by no means as a physical influence
for inasmuch as everything is occupied only internally that is with its own representations the state of the representations of one substance could not stand in active and living connection with that of another but some third cause operating on all without exception was necessary to make the different states correspond with one another
and this did not happen by means of assistance applied in each particular case systema assistentiae but through the unity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with all substances in which they necessarily receive according to the leibnitzian school their existence and permanence consequently also reciprocal correspondence according to universal laws
th
this philosophers celebrated doctrine of space and time in which he intellectualized these forms of sensibility originated in the same delusion of transcendental reflection
if i attempt to represent by the mere understanding the external relations of things i can do so only by employing the conception of their reciprocal action and if i wish to connect one state of the same thing with another state i must avail myself of the notion of the order of cause and effect
and thus leibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community of substances and time as the dynamical sequence of their states
that which space and time possess proper to themselves and independent of things he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions of them whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is held to be a selfexistent intuition antecedent even to things themselves
thus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection of things substances and their states in themselves
but things were intelligible substances substantiae noumena
at the same time he made these conceptions valid of phenomena because he did not allow to sensibility a peculiar mode of intuition but sought all even the empirical representation of objects in the understanding and left to sense naught but the despicable task of confusing and disarranging the representations of the former
but even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning things in themselves by means of the pure understanding which is impossible it could not apply to phenomena which do not represent things in themselves
in such a case i should be obliged in transcendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under the conditions of sensibility and so space and time would not be determinations of things in themselves but of phenomena
what things may be in themselves i know not and need not know because a thing is never presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon
i must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions of reflection
matter is substantia phaenomenon
that in it which is internal i seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies and in all the functions and operations it performs and which are indeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense
i cannot therefore find anything that is absolutely but only what is comparatively internal and which itself consists of external relations
the absolutely internal in matter and as it should be according to the pure understanding is a mere chimera for matter is not an object for the pure understanding
but the transcendental object which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter is a mere nescio quid the nature of which we could not understand even though someone were found able to tell us
for we can understand nothing that does not bring with it something in intuition corresponding to the expressions employed
if by the complaint of being unable to perceive the internal nature of things it is meant that we do not comprehend by the pure understanding what the things which appear to us may be in themselves it is a silly and unreasonable complaint for those who talk thus really desire that we should be able to cognize consequently to intuite things without senses and therefore wish that we possessed a faculty of cognition perfectly different from the human faculty not merely in degree but even as regards intuition and the mode thereof so that thus we should not be men but belong to a class of beings the possibility of whose existence much less their nature and constitution we have no means of cognizing
by observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into the interior of nature and no one can say what progress this knowledge may make in time
but those transcendental questions which pass beyond the limits of nature we could never answer even although all nature were laid open to us because we have not the power of observing our own mind with any other intuition than that of our internal sense
for herein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our faculty of sensibility
its application to an object and the transcendental ground of this unity of subjective and objective lie too deeply concealed for us who cognize ourselves only through the internal sense consequently as phenomena to be able to discover in our existence anything but phenomena the nonsensuous cause of which we at the same time earnestly desire to penetrate to
the great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by the processes of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of the nullity of all conclusions respecting objects which are compared with each other in the understanding alone while it at the same time confirms what we particularly insisted on namely that although phenomena are not included as things in themselves among the objects of the pure understanding they are nevertheless the only things by which our cognition can possess objective reality that is to say which give us intuitions to correspond with our conceptions
when we reflect in a purely logical manner we do nothing more than compare conceptions in our understanding to discover whether both have the same content whether they are selfcontradictory or not whether anything is contained in either conception which of the two is given and which is merely a mode of thinking that given
but if i apply these conceptions to an object in general in the transcendental sense without first determining whether it is an object of sensuous or intellectual intuition certain limitations present themselves which forbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical use of them impossible
and thus these limitations prove that the representation of an object as a thing in general is not only insufficient but without sensuous determination and independently of empirical conditions selfcontradictory that we must therefore make abstraction of all objects as in logic or admitting them must think them under conditions of sensuous intuition that consequently the intelligible requires an altogether peculiar intuition which we do not possess and in the absence of which it is for us nothing while on the other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves
for when i merely think things in general the difference in their external relations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves on the contrary the former presupposes the latter and if the conception of one of two things is not internally different from that of the other i am merely thinking the same thing in different relations
further by the addition of one affirmation reality to the other the positive therein is really augmented and nothing is abstracted or withdrawn from it hence the real in things cannot be in contradiction with or opposition to itselfand so on
the true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of the understanding has as we have shown been so misconceived by leibnitz one of the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times that he has been misled into the construction of a baseless system of intellectual cognition which professes to determine its objects without the intervention of the senses
for this reason the exposition of the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions as the origin of these false principles is of great utility in determining with certainty the proper limits of the understanding
it is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of a conception can be affirmed or denied of any part of it dictum de omni et nullo but it would be absurd so to alter this logical proposition as to say whatever is not contained in a general conception is likewise not contained in the particular conceptions which rank under it for the latter are particular conceptions for the very reason that their content is greater than that which is cogitated in the general conception
and yet the whole intellectual system of leibnitz is based upon this false principle and with it must necessarily fall to the ground together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to the employment of the understanding which have thence originated
leibnitzs principle of the identity of indiscernibles or indistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that if in the conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found it is also not to be met with in things themselves that consequently all things are completely identical numero eadem which are not distinguishable from each other as to quality or quantity in our conceptions of them
but as in the mere conception of anything abstraction has been made of many necessary conditions of intuition that of which abstraction has been made is rashly held to be nonexistent and nothing is attributed to the thing but what is contained in its conception
the conception of a cubic foot of space however i may think it is in itself completely identical
but two cubic feet in space are nevertheless distinct from each other from the sole fact of their being in different places they are numero diversa and these places are conditions of intuition wherein the object of this conception is given and which do not belong to the conception but to the faculty of sensibility
in like manner there is in the conception of a thing no contradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative and merely affirmative conceptions cannot in conjunction produce any negation
but in sensuous intuition wherein reality take for example motion is given we find conditions opposite directionsof which abstraction has been made in the conception of motion in generalwhich render possible a contradiction or opposition not indeed of a logical kindand which from pure positives produce zero
we are therefore not justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement and harmony because no contradiction is discoverable among its conceptions
according to mere conceptions that which is internal is the substratum of all relations or external determinations
when therefore i abstract all conditions of intuition and confine myself solely to the conception of a thing in general i can make abstraction of all external relations and there must nevertheless remain a conception of that which indicates no relation but merely internal determinations
now it seems to follow that in everything substance there is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes all external determinations inasmuch as it renders them possible and that therefore this substratum is something which does not contain any external relations and is consequently simple for corporeal things are never anything but relations at least of their parts external to each other and inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internal determinations than those of the internal sense this substratum is not only simple but also analogously with our internal sense determined through representations that is to say all things are properly monads or simple beings endowed with the power of representation
now all this would be perfectly correct if the conception of a thing were the only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external intuition
it is on the contrary manifest that a permanent phenomenon in space impenetrable extension can contain mere relations and nothing that is absolutely internal and yet be the primary substratum of all external perception
by mere conceptions i cannot think anything external without at the same time thinking something internal for the reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things and without these are impossible
but as an intuition there is something that is space which with all it contains consists of purely formal or indeed real relations which is not found in the mere conception of a thing in general and this presents to us the substratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone i cannot say because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions without something absolutely internal there is also in the things themselves which are contained under these conceptions and in their intuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal does not serve as the foundation
for when we have made abstraction of all the conditions of intuition there certainly remains in the mere conception nothing but the internal in general through which alone the external is possible
but this necessity which is grounded upon abstraction alone does not obtain in the case of things themselves in so far as they are given in intuition with such determinations as express mere relations without having anything internal as their foundation for they are not things of a thing of which we can neither for they are not things in themselves but only phenomena
what we cognize in matter is nothing but relations what we call its internal determinations are but comparatively internal
but there are some selfsubsistent and permanent through which a determined object is given
that i when abstraction is made of these relations have nothing more to think does not destroy the conception of a thing as phenomenon nor the conception of an object in abstracto but it does away with the possibility of an object that is determinable according to mere conceptions that is of a noumenon
it is certainly startling to hear that a thing consists solely of relations but this thing is simply a phenomenon and cannot be cogitated by means of the mere categories it does itself consist in the mere relation of something in general to the senses
in the same way we cannot cogitate relations of things in abstracto if we commence with conceptions alone in any other manner than that one is the cause of determinations in the other for that is itself the conception of the understanding or category of relation
but as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition we lose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines to each of its parts its place that is the form of sensibility space and yet this mode antecedes all empirical causality
if any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge and to say that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition to each other it will be requisite for him to adduce an example of this pure and nonsensuous reality that it may be understood whether the notion represents something or nothing
but an example cannot be found except in experience which never presents to us anything more than phenomena and thus the proposition means nothing more than that the conception which contains only affirmatives does not contain anything negativea proposition nobody ever doubted
if by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought by means of the pure categories without the need of the schemata of sensibility such objects are impossible
for the condition of the objective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode of our sensuous intuition whereby objects are given and if we make abstraction of the latter the former can have no relation to an object
and even if we should suppose a different kind of intuition from our own still our functions of thought would have no use or signification in respect thereof
but if we understand by the term objects of a nonsensuous intuition in respect of which our categories are not valid and of which we can accordingly have no knowledge neither intuition nor conception in this merely negative sense noumena must be admitted
for this is no more than saying that our mode of intuition is not applicable to all things but only to objects of our senses that consequently its objective validity is limited and that room is therefore left for another kind of intuition and thus also for things that may be objects of it
but in this sense the conception of a noumenon is problematical that is to say it is the notion of that it that it is possible nor that it is impossible inasmuch as we do not know of any mode of intuition besides the sensuous or of any other sort of conceptions than the categoriesa mode of intuition and a kind of conception neither of which is applicable to a nonsensuous object
we are on this account incompetent to extend the sphere of our objects of thought beyond the conditions of our sensibility and to assume the existence of objects of pure thought that is of noumena inasmuch as these have no true positive signification
for it must be confessed of the categories that they are not of themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves and without the data of sensibility are mere subjective forms of the unity of the understanding
thought is certainly not a product of the senses and in so far is not limited by them but it does not therefore follow that it may be employed purely and without the intervention of sensibility for it would then be without reference to an object
and we cannot call a noumenon an object of pure thought for the representation thereof is but the problematical conception of an object for a perfectly different intuition and a perfectly different understanding from ours both of which are consequently themselves problematical
the conception of a noumenon is therefore not the conception of an object but merely a problematical conception inseparably connected with the limitation of our sensibility
that is to say this conception contains the answer to the question are there objects quite unconnected with and independent of our intuitiona question to which only an indeterminate answer can be given
that answer is inasmuch as sensuous intuition does not apply to all things without distinction there remains room for other and different objects
the existence of these problematical objects is therefore not absolutely denied in the absence of a determinate conception of them but as no category is valid in respect of them neither must they be admitted as objects for our understanding
understanding accordingly limits sensibility without at the same time enlarging its own field
while moreover it forbids sensibility to apply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to the sphere of phenomena it cogitates an object in itself only however as a transcendental object which is the cause of a phenomenon consequently not itself a phenomenon and which cannot be thought either as a quantity or as reality or as substance because these conceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine an objectan object therefore of which we are quite unable to say whether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us whether it would be annihilated together with sensibility or if this were taken away would continue to exist
if we wish to call this object a noumenon because the representation of it is nonsensuous we are at liberty to do so
but as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of our understanding the representation is for us quite void and is available only for the indication of the limits of our sensuous intuition thereby leaving at the same time an empty space which we are competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience nor of the pure understanding
the critique of the pure understanding accordingly does not permit us to create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are presented to us as phenomena and to stray into intelligible worlds nay it does not even allow us to endeavour to form so much as a conception of them
the specious error which leads to thisand which is a perfectly excusable onelies in the fact that the employment of the understanding contrary to its proper purpose and destination is made transcendental and objects that is possible intuitions are made to regulate themselves according to conceptions instead of the conceptions arranging themselves according to the intuitions on which alone their own objective validity rests
now the reason of this again is that apperception and with it thought antecedes all possible determinate arrangement of representations
accordingly we think something in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously but on the other distinguish the general and in abstracto represented object from this particular mode of intuiting it
in this case there remains a mode of determining the object by mere thought which is really but a logical form without content which however seems to us to be a mode of the existence of the object in itself noumenon without regard to intuition which is limited to our senses
before ending this transcendental analytic we must make an addition which although in itself of no particular importance seems to be necessary to the completeness of the system
the highest conception with which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins is the division into possible and impossible
but as all division presupposes a divided conception a still higher one must exist and this is the conception of an object in generalproblematically understood and without its being decided whether it is something or nothing
as the categories are the only conceptions which apply to objects in general the distinguishing of an object whether it is something or nothing must proceed according to the order and direction of the categories
to the categories of quantity that is the conceptions of all many and one the conception which annihilates all that is the conception of none is opposed
and thus the object of a conception to which no intuition can be found to correspond is nothing
that is it is a conception without an object ens rationis like noumena which cannot be considered possible in the sphere of reality though they must not therefore be held to be impossibleor like certain new fundamental forces in matter the existence of which is cogitable without contradiction though as examples from experience are not forthcoming they must not be regarded as possible
reality is something negation is nothing that is a conception of the absence of an object as cold a shadow nihil privativum
the mere form of intuition without substance is in itself no object but the merely formal condition of an object as phenomenon as pure space and pure time
these are certainly something as forms of intuition but are not themselves objects which are intuited ens imaginarium
the object of a conception which is selfcontradictory is nothing because the conception is nothingis impossible as a figure composed of two straight lines nihil negativum
the table of this division of the conception of nothing the corresponding division of the conception of something does not require special description must therefore be arranged as follows
nothing as
as empty conception without object ens rationis empty object of empty intuition a conception without object nihil privativum ens imaginarium empty object without conception nihil negativum
we see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativum or pure nothing by the consideration that the former must not be reckoned among possibilities because it is a mere fictionthough not selfcontradictory while the latter is completely opposed to all possibility inasmuch as the conception annihilates itself
both however are empty conceptions
on the other hand the nihil privativum and ens imaginarium are empty data for conceptions
if light be not given to the senses we cannot represent to ourselves darkness and if extended objects are not perceived we cannot represent space
neither the negation nor the mere form of intuition can without something real be an object
second divisiontranscendental logic
transcendental dialectic
introduction
i
of transcendental illusory appearance
we termed dialectic in general a logic of appearance
this does not signify a doctrine of probability for probability is truth only cognized upon insufficient grounds and though the information it gives us is imperfect it is not therefore deceitful
hence it must not be separated from the analytical part of logic
still less must phenomenon and appearance be held to be identical
for truth or illusory appearance does not reside in the object in so far as it is intuited but in the judgement upon the object in so far as it is thought
it is therefore quite correct to say that the senses do not err not because they always judge correctly but because they do not judge at all
hence truth and error consequently also illusory appearance as the cause of error are only to be found in a judgement that is in the relation of an object to our understanding
in a cognition which completely harmonizes with the laws of the understanding no error can exist
in a representation of the sensesas not containing any judgementthere is also no error
but no power of nature can of itself deviate from its own laws
hence neither the understanding per se without the influence of another cause nor the senses per se would fall into error the former could not because if it acts only according to its own laws the effect the judgement must necessarily accord with these laws
but in accordance with the laws of the understanding consists the formal element in all truth
in the senses there is no judgementneither a true nor a false one
but as we have no source of cognition besides these two it follows that error is caused solely by the unobserved influence of the sensibility upon the understanding
and thus it happens that the subjective grounds of a judgement and are confounded with the objective and cause them to deviate from their proper determination just as a body in motion would always of itself proceed in a straight line but if another impetus gives to it a different direction it will then start off into a curvilinear line of motion
to distinguish the peculiar action of the understanding from the power which mingles with it it is necessary to consider an erroneous judgement as the diagonal between two forces that determine the judgement in two different directions which as it were form an angle and to resolve this composite operation into the simple ones of the understanding and the sensibility
in pure priori judgements this must be done by means of transcendental reflection whereby as has been already shown each representation has its place appointed in the corresponding faculty of cognition and consequently the influence of the one faculty upon the other is made apparent
sensibility subjected to the understanding as the object upon which the understanding employs its functions is the source of real cognitions
but in so far as it exercises an influence upon the action of the understanding and determines it to judgement sensibility is itself the cause of error
it is not at present our business to treat of empirical illusory appearance for example optical illusion which occurs in the empirical application of otherwise correct rules of the understanding and in which the judgement is misled by the influence of imagination
our purpose is to speak of transcendental illusory appearance which influences principlesthat are not even applied to experience for in this case we should possess a sure test of their correctnessbut which leads us in disregard of all the warnings of criticism completely beyond the empirical employment of the categories and deludes us with the chimera of an extension of the sphere of the pure understanding
we shall term those principles the application of which is confined entirely within the limits of possible experience immanent those on the other hand which transgress these limits we shall call transcendent principles
but by these latter i do not understand principles of the transcendental use or misuse of the categories which is in reality a mere fault of the judgement when not under due restraint from criticism and therefore not paying sufficient attention to the limits of the sphere in which the pure understanding is allowed to exercise its functions but real principles which exhort us to break down all those barriers and to lay claim to a perfectly new field of cognition which recognizes no line of demarcation
thus transcendental and transcendent are not identical terms
the principles of the pure understanding which we have already propounded ought to be of empirical and not of transcendental use that is they are not applicable to any object beyond the sphere of experience
a principle which removes these limits nay which authorizes us to overstep them is called transcendent
if our criticism can succeed in exposing the illusion in these pretended principles those which are limited in their employment to the sphere of experience may be called in opposition to the others immanent principles of the pure understanding
logical illusion which consists merely in the imitation of the form of reason the illusion in sophistical syllogisms arises entirely from a want of due attention to logical rules
so soon as the attention is awakened to the case before us this illusion totally disappears
transcendental illusion on the contrary does not cease to exist even after it has been exposed and its nothingness clearly perceived by means of transcendental criticism
take for example the illusion in the proposition the world must have a beginning in time
the cause of this is as follows
in our reason subjectively considered as a faculty of human cognition there exist fundamental rules and maxims of its exercise which have completely the appearance of objective principles
now from this cause it happens that the subjective necessity of a certain connection of our conceptions is regarded as an objective necessity of the determination of things in themselves
this illusion it is impossible to avoid just as we cannot avoid perceiving that the sea appears to be higher at a distance than it is near the shore because we see the former by means of higher rays than the latter or which is a still stronger case as even the astronomer cannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising than some time afterwards although he is not deceived by this illusion
transcendental dialectic will therefore content itself with exposing the illusory appearance in transcendental judgements and guarding us against it but to make it as in the case of logical illusion entirely disappear and cease to be illusion is utterly beyond its power
for we have here to do with a natural and unavoidable illusion which rests upon subjective principles and imposes these upon us as objective while logical dialectic in the detection of sophisms has to do merely with an error in the logical consequence of the propositions or with an artificially constructed illusion in imitation of the natural error
there is therefore a natural and unavoidable dialectic of pure reasonnot that in which the bungler from want of the requisite knowledge involves himself nor that which the sophist devises for the purpose of misleading but that which is an inseparable adjunct of human reason and which even after its illusions have been exposed does not cease to deceive and continually to lead reason into momentary errors which it becomes necessary continually to remove
ii
of pure reason as the seat of transcendental illusory appearance
a
of reason in general
all our knowledge begins with sense proceeds thence to understanding and ends with reason beyond which nothing higher can be discovered in the human mind for elaborating the matter of intuition and subjecting it to the highest unity of thought
at this stage of our inquiry it is my duty to give an explanation of this the highest faculty of cognition and i confess i find myself here in some difficulty
of reason as of the understanding there is a merely formal that is logical use in which it makes abstraction of all content of cognition but there is also a real use inasmuch as it contains in itself the source of certain conceptions and principles which it does not borrow either from the senses or the understanding
the former faculty has been long defined by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusion in contradistinction to immediate conclusions consequentiae immediatae but the nature of the latter which itself generates conceptions is not to be understood from this definition
now as a division of reason into a logical and a transcendental faculty presents itself here it becomes necessary to seek for a higher conception of this source of cognition which shall comprehend both conceptions
in this we may expect according to the analogy of the conceptions of the understanding that the logical conception will give us the key to the transcendental and that the table of the functions of the former will present us with the clue to the conceptions of reason
in the former part of our transcendental logic we defined the understanding to be the faculty of rules reason may be distinguished from understanding as the faculty of principles
the term principle is ambiguous and commonly signifies merely a cognition that may be employed as a principle although it is not in itself and as regards its proper origin entitled to the distinction
every general proposition even if derived from experience by the process of induction may serve as the major in a syllogism but it is not for that reason a principle
mathematical axioms for example there can be only one straight line between two points are general priori cognitions and are therefore rightly denominated principles relatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them
but i cannot for this reason say that i cognize this property of a straight line from principlesi cognize it only in pure intuition
cognition from principles then is that cognition in which i cognize the particular in the general by means of conceptions
thus every syllogism is a form of the deduction of a cognition from a principle
for the major always gives a conception through which everything that is subsumed under the condition thereof is cognized according to a principle
now as every general cognition may serve as the major in a syllogism and the understanding presents us with such general priori propositions they may be termed principles in respect of their possible use
but if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in relation to their origin we shall find them to be anything rather than cognitions from conceptions
for they would not even be possible priori if we could not rely on the assistance of pure intuition in mathematics or on that of the conditions of a possible experience
that everything that happens has a cause cannot be concluded from the general conception of that which happens on the contrary the principle of causality instructs us as to the mode of obtaining from that which happens a determinate empirical conception
synthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannot supply and they alone are entitled to be called principles
at the same time all general propositions may be termed comparative principles
it has been a longcherished wishthat who knows how late may one day be happily accomplishedthat the principles of the endless variety of civil laws should be investigated and exposed for in this way alone can we find the secret of simplifying legislation
but in this case laws are nothing more than limitations of our freedom upon conditions under which it subsists in perfect harmony with itself they consequently have for their object that which is completely our own work and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means of these conceptions
but how objects as things in themselveshow the nature of things is subordinated to principles and is to be determined according to conceptions is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to answer
be this however as it mayfor on this point our investigation is yet to be madeit is at least manifest from what we have said that cognition from principles is something very different from cognition by means of the understanding which may indeed precede other cognitions in the form of a principle but in itselfin so far as it is syntheticalis neither based upon mere thought nor contains a general proposition drawn from conceptions alone
the understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity of phenomena by virtue of rules the reason is a faculty for the production of unity of rules of the understanding under principles
reason therefore never applies directly to experience or to any sensuous object its object is on the contrary the understanding to the manifold cognition of which it gives a unity priori by means of conceptionsa unity which may be called rational unity and which is of a nature very different from that of the unity produced by the understanding
the above is the general conception of the faculty of reason in so far as it has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence of examples
these will be given in the sequel
b
of the logical use of reason
a distinction is commonly made between that which is immediately cognized and that which is inferred or concluded
that in a figure which is bounded by three straight lines there are three angles is an immediate cognition but that these angles are together equal to two right angles is an inference or conclusion
now as we are constantly employing this mode of thought and have thus become quite accustomed to it we no longer remark the above distinction and as in the case of the socalled deceptions of sense consider as immediately perceived what has really been inferred
in every reasoning or syllogism there is a fundamental proposition afterwards a second drawn from it and finally the conclusion which connects the truth in the first with the truth in the secondand that infallibly
if the judgement concluded is so contained in the first proposition that it can be deduced from it without the meditation of a third notion the conclusion is called immediate consequentia immediata i prefer the term conclusion of the understanding
but if in addition to the fundamental cognition a second judgement is necessary for the production of the conclusion it is called a conclusion of the reason
in the proposition all men are mortal are contained the propositions some men are mortal nothing that is not mortal is a man and these are therefore immediate conclusions from the first
on the other hand the proposition all the learned are mortal is not contained in the main proposition for the conception of a learned man does not occur in it and it can be deduced from the main proposition only by means of a mediating judgement
in every syllogism i first cogitate a rule the major by means of the understanding
in the next place i subsume a cognition under the condition of the rule and this is the minor by means of the judgement
and finally i determine my cognition by means of the predicate of the rule this is the conclusio consequently i determine it priori by means of the reason
the relations therefore which the major proposition as the rule represents between a cognition and its condition constitute the different kinds of syllogisms
these are just threefoldanalogously with all judgements in so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a cognition in the understandingnamely categorical hypothetical and disjunctive
when as often happens the conclusion is a judgement which may follow from other given judgements through which a perfectly different object is cogitated i endeavour to discover in the understanding whether the assertion in this conclusion does not stand under certain conditions according to a general rule
if i find such a condition and if the object mentioned in the conclusion can be subsumed under the given condition then this conclusion follows from a rule which is also valid for other objects of cognition
from this we see that reason endeavours to subject the great variety of the cognitions of the understanding to the smallest possible number of principles general conditions and thus to produce in it the highest unity
c
of the pure use of reason
can we isolate reason and if so is it in this case a peculiar source of conceptions and judgements which spring from it alone and through which it can be applied to objects or is it merely a subordinate faculty whose duty it is to give a certain form to given cognitionsa form which is called logical and through which the cognitions of the understanding are subordinated to each other and lower rules to higher those to wit whose condition comprises in its sphere the condition of the others in so far as this can be done by comparison this is the question which we have at present to answer
manifold variety of rules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason for the purpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance with itself just as understanding subjects the manifold content of intuition to conceptions and thereby introduces connection into it
but this principle prescribes no law to objects and does not contain any ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them as such but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of the content of the understanding
the purpose of this law is by a comparison of the conceptions of the understanding to reduce them to the smallest possible number although at the same time it does not justify us in demanding from objects themselves such a uniformity as might contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphere of the understanding or in expecting that it will itself thus receive from them objective validity
in one word the question is does reason in itself that is does pure reason contain priori synthetical principles and rules and what are those principles
the formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us sufficient information in regard to the ground on which the transcendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognition will rest
reason as observed in the syllogistic process is not applicable to intuitions for the purpose of subjecting them to rulesfor this is the province of the understanding with its categoriesbut to conceptions and judgements
if pure reason does apply to objects and the intuition of them it does so not immediately but mediatelythrough the understanding and its judgements which have a direct relation to the senses and their intuition for the purpose of determining their objects
the unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible experience but is essentially different from this unity which is that of the understanding
that everything which happens has a cause is not a principle cognized and prescribed by reason
this principle makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason which without a reference to possible experience could never have produced by means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity
reason in its logical use endeavours to discover the general condition of its judgement the conclusion and a syllogism is itself nothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition under a general rule the major
now as this rule may itself be subjected to the same process of reason and thus the condition of the condition be sought by means of a prosyllogism as long as the process can be continued it is very manifest that the peculiar principle of reason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition of the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former is completed
but this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason unless we admit that if the conditioned is given the whole series of conditions subordinated to one anothera series which is consequently itself unconditionedis also given that is contained in the object and its connection
but this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical for analytically the conditioned certainly relates to some condition but not to the unconditioned
from this principle also there must originate different synthetical propositions of which the pure understanding is perfectly ignorant for it has to do only with objects of a possible experience the cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned
the unconditioned if it does really exist must be especially considered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it from whatever is conditioned and will thus afford us material for many priori synthetical propositions
the principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason will however be transcendent in relation to phenomena that is to say it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this principle
it is therefore completely different from all principles of the understanding the use made of which is entirely immanent their object and purpose being merely the possibility of experience
now our duty in the transcendental dialectic is as follows
to discover whether the principle that the series of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena or of thought in general extends to the unconditioned is objectively true or not what consequences result therefrom affecting the empirical use of the understanding or rather whether there exists any such objectively valid proposition of reason and whether it is not on the contrary a merely logical precept which directs us to ascend perpetually to still higher conditions to approach completeness in the series of them and thus to introduce into our cognition the highest possible unity of reason
we must ascertain i say whether this requirement of reason has not been regarded by a misunderstanding as a transcendental principle of pure reason which postulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in objects themselves
we must show moreover the misconceptions and illusions that intrude into syllogisms the major proposition of which pure reason has supplieda proposition which has perhaps more of the character of a petitio than of a postulatumand that proceed from experience upwards to its conditions
the solution of these problems is our task in transcendental dialectic which we are about to expose even at its source that lies deep in human reason
we shall divide it into two parts the first of which will treat of the transcendent conceptions of pure reason the second of transcendent and dialectical syllogisms
transcendental dialecticbook iof the conceptions of pure reason
the conceptions of pure reasonwe do not here speak of the possibility of themare not obtained by reflection but by inference or conclusion
the conceptions of understanding are also cogitated priori antecedently to experience and render it possible but they contain nothing but the unity of reflection upon phenomena in so far as these must necessarily belong to a possible empirical consciousness
through them alone are cognition and the determination of an object possible
it is from them accordingly that we receive material for reasoning and antecedently to them we possess no priori conceptions of objects from which they might be deduced on the other hand the sole basis of their objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on them as containing the intellectual form of all experience of restricting their application and influence to the sphere of experience
but the term conception of reason or rational conception itself indicates that it does not confine itself within the limits of experience because its objectmatter is a cognition of which every empirical cognition is but a partnay the whole of possible experience may be itself but a part of ita cognition to which no actual experience ever fully attains although it does always pertain to it
the aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension as that of the conceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions
if they contain the unconditioned they relate to that to which all experience is subordinate but which is never itself an object of experiencethat towards which reason tends in all its conclusions from experience and by the standard of which it estimates the degree of their empirical use but which is never itself an element in an empirical synthesis
if notwithstanding such conceptions possess objective validity they may be called conceptus ratiocinati conceptions legitimately concluded in cases where they do not they have been admitted on account of having the appearance of being correctly concluded and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes sophistical conceptions
but as this can only be sufficiently demonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to the dialectical conclusions of reason we shall omit any consideration of it in this place
as we called the pure conceptions of the understanding categories we shall also distinguish those of pure reason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas
these terms however we must in the first place explain and justify
section iof ideas in general
despite the great wealth of words which european languages possess the thinker finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suited to his conception for want of which he is unable to make himself intelligible either to others or to himself
to coin new words is a pretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful and before recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient it is advisable to examine the dead and learned languages with the hope and the probability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of the notion we have in our minds
in this case even if the original meaning of the word has become somewhat uncertain from carelessness or want of caution on the part of the authors of it it is always better to adhere to and confirm its proper meaningeven although it may be doubtful whether it was formerly used in exactly this sensethan to make our labour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves intelligible
for this reason when it happens that there exists only a single word to express a certain conception and this word in its usual acceptation is thoroughly adequate to the conception the accurate distinction of which from related conceptions is of great importance we ought not to employ the expression improvidently or for the sake of variety and elegance of style use it as a synonym for other cognate words
it is our duty on the contrary carefully to preserve its peculiar signification as otherwise it easily happens that when the attention of the reader is no longer particularly attracted to the expression and it is lost amid the multitude of other words of very different import the thought which it conveyed and which it alone conveyed is lost with it
plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he meant by it something which is never derived from the senses but which far transcends even the conceptions of the understanding with which aristotle occupied himself inasmuch as in experience nothing perfectly corresponding to them could be found
ideas are according to him archetypes of things themselves and not merely keys to possible experiences like the categories
in his view they flow from the highest reason by which they have been imparted to human reason which however exists no longer in its original state but is obliged with great labour to recall by reminiscencewhich is called philosophythe old but now sadly obscured ideas
i will not here enter upon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime philosopher attached to this expression
i shall content myself with remarking that it is nothing unusual in common conversation as well as in written works by comparing the thoughts which an author has delivered upon a subject to understand him better than he understood himself inasmuch as he may not have sufficiently determined his conception and thus have sometimes spoken nay even thought in opposition to his own opinions
plato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has the feeling of a much higher vocation than that of merely spelling out phenomena according to synthetical unity for the purpose of being able to read them as experience and that our reason naturally raises itself to cognitions far too elevated to admit of the possibility of an object given by experience corresponding to themcognitions which are nevertheless real and are not mere phantoms of the brain
this philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is practical that is which rests upon freedom which in its turn ranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason
he who would derive from experience the conceptions of virtue who would make as many have really done that which at best can but serve as an imperfectly illustrative example a model for or the formation of a perfectly adequate idea on the subject would in fact transform virtue into a nonentity changeable according to time and circumstance and utterly incapable of being employed as a rule
on the contrary every one is conscious that when any one is held up to him as a model of virtue he compares this socalled model with the true original which he possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard
but this standard is the idea of virtue in relation to which all possible objects of experience are indeed serviceable as examplesproofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which the conception of virtue demandsbut certainly not as archetypes
that the actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the requirements of the pure ideas of reason does not prove the thought to be chimerical
for only through this idea are all judgements as to moral merit or demerit possible it consequently lies at the foundation of every approach to moral perfection however far removed from it the obstacles in human natureindeterminable as to degreemay keep us
he certainly extended the application of his conception to speculative cognitions also provided they were given pure and completely priori nay even to mathematics although this science cannot possess an object otherwhere than in possible experience
i cannot follow him in this and as little can i follow him in his mystical deduction of these ideas or in his hypostatization of them although in truth the elevated and exaggerated language which he employed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more subdued and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things
the platonic republic has become proverbial as an exampleand a striking oneof imaginary perfection such as can exist only in the brain of the idle thinker and brucker ridicules the philosopher for maintaining that a prince can never govern well unless he is participant in the ideas
but we should do better to follow up this thought and where this admirable thinker leaves us without assistance employ new efforts to place it in clearer light rather than carelessly fling it aside as useless under the very miserable and pernicious pretext of impracticability
a constitution of the greatest possible human freedom according to laws by which the liberty of every individual can consist with the liberty of every other not of the greatest possible happiness for this follows necessarily from the former is to say the least a necessary idea which must be placed at the foundation not only of the first plan of the constitution of a state but of all its laws
and in this it not necessary at the outset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our wayobstacles which perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character of human nature but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas in legislation
for there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy of a philosopher than the vulgar appeal to a socalled adverse experience which indeed would not have existed if those institutions had been established at the proper time and in accordance with ideas while instead of this conceptions crude for the very reason that they have been drawn from experience have marred and frustrated all our better views and intentions
the more legislation and government are in harmony with this idea the more rare do punishments become and thus it is quite reasonable to maintain as plato did that in a perfect state no punishments at all would be necessary
now although a perfect state may never exist the idea is not on that account the less just which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of a constitution in order to bring legislative government always nearer and nearer to the greatest possible perfection
for at what precise degree human nature must stop in its progress and how wide must be the chasm which must necessarily exist between the idea and its realization are problems which no one can or ought to determineand for this reason that it is the destination of freedom to overstep all assigned limits between itself and the idea
but not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent and where ideas are operative causes of actions and their objects that is to say in the region of ethics but also in regard to nature herself plato saw clear proofs of an origin from ideas
a plant and animal the regular order of natureprobably also the disposition of the whole universegive manifest evidence that they are possible only by means of and according to ideas that indeed no one creature under the individual conditions of its existence perfectly harmonizes with the idea of the most perfect of its kindjust as little as man with the idea of humanity which nevertheless he bears in his soul as the archetypal standard of his actions that notwithstanding these ideas are in the highest sense individually unchangeably and completely determined and are the original causes of things and that the totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fully adequate to that idea
setting aside the exaggerations of expression in the writings of this philosopher the mental power exhibited in this ascent from the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to the architectonic connection thereof according to ends that is ideas is an effort which deserves imitation and claims respect
but as regards the principles of ethics of legislation and of religion spheres in which ideas alone render experience possible although they never attain to full expression therein he has vindicated for himself a position of peculiar merit which is not appreciated only because it is judged by the very empirical rules the validity of which as principles is destroyed by ideas
for as regards nature experience presents us with rules and is the source of truth but in relation to ethical laws experience is the parent of illusion and it is in the highest degree reprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what i ought to do from what is done
we must however omit the consideration of these important subjects the development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity of philosophy and confine ourselves for the present to the more humble but not less useful task of preparing a firm foundation for those majestic edifices of moral science
for this foundation has been hitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason in its confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions
our present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with the transcendental use made of pure reason its principles and ideas that we may be able properly to determine and value its influence and real worth
but before bringing these introductory remarks to a close i beg those who really have philosophy at heartand their number is but smallif they shall find themselves convinced by the considerations following as well as by those above to exert themselves to preserve to the expression idea its original signification and to take care that it be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts of representations are loosely designatedthat the interests of science may not thereby suffer
we are in no want of words to denominate adequately every mode of representation without the necessity of encroaching upon terms which are proper to others
the following is a graduated list of them
the genus is representation in general representatio
under it stands representation with consciousness perceptio
a perception which relates solely to the subject as a modification of its state is a sensation sensatio an objective perception is a cognition cognitio
a cognition is either an intuition or a conception intuitus vel conceptus
the former has an immediate relation to the object and is singular and individual the latter has but a mediate relation by means of a characteristic mark which may be common to several things
a conception is either empirical or pure
a pure conception in so far as it has its origin in the understanding alone and is not the conception of a pure sensuous image is called notio
a conception formed from notions which transcends the possibility of experience is an idea or a conception of reason
to one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions it must be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour red called an idea
it ought not even to be called a notion or conception of understanding
section ii
of transcendental ideas
transcendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our cognition can contain the origin of pure conceptions priori conceptions which represent objects antecedently to all experience or rather indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible an empirical cognition of objects
the form of judgementsconverted into a conception of the synthesis of intuitionsproduced the categories which direct the employment of the understanding in experience
this consideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms when applied to synthetical unity of intuitions following the rule of the categories will contain the origin of particular priori conceptions which we may call pure conceptions of reason or transcendental ideas and which will determine the use of the understanding in the totality of experience according to principles
the function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a cognition according to conceptions and the syllogism itself is a judgement which is determined priori in the whole extent of its condition
the proposition caius is mortal is one which may be obtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone but my wish is to find a conception which contains the condition under which the predicate of this judgement is givenin this case the conception of manand after subsuming under this condition taken in its whole extent all men are mortal i determine according to it the cognition of the object thought and say caius is mortal
hence in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a certain object after having thought it in the major in its whole extent under a certain condition
this complete quantity of the extent in relation to such a condition is called universality universalitas
to this corresponds totality universitas of conditions in the synthesis of intuitions
the transcendental conception of reason is therefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of the conditions of a given conditioned
now as the unconditioned alone renders possible totality of conditions and conversely the totality of conditions is itself always unconditioned a pure rational conception in general can be defined and explained by means of the conception of the unconditioned in so far as it contains a basis for the synthesis of the conditioned
to the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by means of the categories the number of pure rational conceptions will correspond
we must therefore seek for first an unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject secondly of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series thirdly of the disjunctive synthesis of parts in a system
there are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms each of which proceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditionedone to the subject which cannot be employed as predicate another to the presupposition which supposes nothing higher than itself and the third to an aggregate of the members of the complete division of a conception
hence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of conditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reasonat least as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned
they may have no valid application corresponding to their transcendental employment in concreto and be thus of no greater utility than to direct the understanding how while extending them as widely as possible to maintain its exercise and application in perfect consistence and harmony
but while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of the unconditioned as the common title of all conceptions of reason we again light upon an expression which we find it impossible to dispense with and which nevertheless owing to the ambiguity attaching to it from long abuse we cannot employ with safety
the word absolute is one of the few words which in its original signification was perfectly adequate to the conception it was intended to conveya conception which no other word in the same language exactly suits and the lossor which is the same thing the incautious and loose employmentof which must be followed by the loss of the conception itself
and as it is a conception which occupies much of the attention of reason its loss would be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy
the word absolute is at present frequently used to denote that something can be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically
in this sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible in itself internewhich is in fact the least that one can predicate of an object
on the other hand it is sometimes employed to indicate that a thing is valid in all respectsfor example absolute sovereignty
absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible in all relations and in every respect and this is the most that can be predicated of the possibility of a thing
now these significations do in truth frequently coincide
thus for example that which is intrinsically impossible is also impossible in all relations that is absolutely impossible
but in most cases they differ from each other toto caelo and i can by no means conclude that because a thing is in itself possible it is also possible in all relations and therefore absolutely
nay more i shall in the sequel show that absolute necessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity and that therefore it must not be considered as synonymous with it
of an opposite which is intrinsically impossible we may affirm that it is in all respects impossible and that consequently the thing itself of which this is the opposite is absolutely necessary but i cannot reason conversely and say the opposite of that which is absolutely necessary is intrinsically impossible that is that the absolute necessity of things is an internal necessity
for this internal necessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the least conception cannot be connected while the conception of the necessity of a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations
now as the loss of a conception of great utility in speculative science cannot be a matter of indifference to the philosopher i trust that the proper determination and careful preservation of the expression on which the conception depends will likewise be not indifferent to him
in this enlarged signification then shall i employ the word absolute in opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect for the latter is restricted by conditions the former is valid without any restriction whatever
now the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothing else than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does not rest satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely that is in all respects and relations unconditioned
for pure reason leaves to the understanding everything that immediately relates to the object of intuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination
the former restricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of the conceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out the synthetical unity which is cogitated in the category even to the unconditioned
this unity may hence be called the rational unity of phenomena as the other which the category expresses may be termed the unity of the understanding
reason therefore has an immediate relation to the use of the understanding not indeed in so far as the latter contains the ground of possible experience for the conception of the absolute totality of conditions is not a conception that can be employed in experience because no experience is unconditioned but solely for the purpose of directing it to a certain unity of which the understanding has no conception and the aim of which is to collect into an absolute whole all acts of the understanding
hence the objective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is always transcendent while that of the pure conceptions of the understanding must according to their nature be always immanent inasmuch as they are limited to possible experience
i understand by idea a necessary conception of reason to which no corresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense
accordingly the pure conceptions of reason at present under consideration are transcendental ideas
they are conceptions of pure reason for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by means of an absolute totality of conditions
they are not mere fictions but natural and necessary products of reason and have hence a necessary relation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding
and finally they are transcendent and overstep the limits of all experiences in which consequently no object can ever be presented that would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea
when we use the word idea we say as regards its object an object of the pure understanding a great deal but as regards its subject that is in respect of its reality under conditions of experience exceedingly little because the idea as the conception of a maximum can never be completely and adequately presented in concreto
now as in the merely speculative employment of reason the latter is properly the sole aim and as in this case the approximation to a conception which is never attained in practice is the same thing as if the conception were nonexistentit is commonly said of the conception of this kind it is only an idea
so we might very well say the absolute totality of all phenomena is only an idea for as we never can present an adequate representation of it it remains for us a problem incapable of solution
on the other hand as in the practical use of the understanding we have only to do with action and practice according to rules an idea of pure reason can always be given really in concreto although only partially nay it is the indispensable condition of all practical employment of reason
the practice or execution of the idea is always limited and defective but nevertheless within indeterminable boundaries consequently always under the influence of the conception of an absolute perfection
and thus the practical idea is always in the highest degree fruitful and in relation to real actions indispensably necessary
in the idea pure reason possesses even causality and the power of producing that which its conception contains
hence we cannot say of wisdom in a disparaging way it is only an idea
for for the very reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possible aims it must be for all practical exertions and endeavours the primitive condition and rulea rule which if not constitutive is at least limitative
now although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason they are only ideas we must not on this account look upon them as superfluous and nugatory
for although no object can be determined by them they can be of great utility unobserved and at the basis of the edifice of the understanding as the canon for its extended and selfconsistent exercisea canon which indeed does not enable it to cognize more in an object than it would cognize by the help of its own conceptions but which guides it more securely in its cognition
not to mention that they perhaps render possible a transition from our conceptions of nature and the nonego to the practical conceptions and thus produce for even ethical ideas keeping so to speak and connection with the speculative cognitions of reason
the explication of all this must be looked for in the sequel
but setting aside in conformity with our original purpose the consideration of the practical ideas we proceed to contemplate reason in its speculative use alone nay in a still more restricted sphere to wit in the transcendental use and here must strike into the same path which we followed in our deduction of the categories
that is to say we shall consider the logical form of the cognition of reason that we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source of conceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves as determined synthetically priori in relation to one or other of the functions of reason
reason considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of cognition is the faculty of conclusion that is of mediate judgementby means of the subsumption of the condition of a possible judgement under the condition of a given judgement
the given judgement is the general rule major
the subsumption of the condition of another possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the minor
the actual judgement which enounces the assertion of the rule in the subsumed case is the conclusion conclusio
the rule predicates something generally under a certain condition
the condition of the rule is satisfied in some particular case
it follows that what was valid in general under that condition must also be considered as valid in the particular case which satisfies this condition
it is very plain that reason attains to a cognition by means of acts of the understanding which constitute a series of conditions
when i arrive at the proposition all bodies are changeable by beginning with the more remote cognition in which the conception of body does not appear but which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception all compound is changeable by proceeding from this to a less remote cognition which stands under the condition of the former bodies are compound and hence to a third which at length connects for me the remote cognition changeable with the one before me consequently bodies are changeablei have arrived at a cognition conclusion through a series of conditions premisses
now every series whose exponent of the categorical or hypothetical judgement is given can be continued consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us to the ratiocinatio polysyllogistica which is a series of syllogisms that can be continued either on the side of the conditions per prosyllogismos or of the conditioned per episyllogismos to an indefinite extent
but we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms that is of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditions of a given cognition in other words the ascending series of syllogisms must have a very different relation to the faculty of reason from that of the descending series that is the progressive procedure of reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms
for as in the former case the cognition conclusio is given only as conditioned reason can attain to this cognition only under the presupposition that all the members of the series on the side of the conditions are given totality in the series of premisses because only under this supposition is the judgement we may be considering possible priori while on the side of the conditioned or the inferences only an incomplete and becoming and not a presupposed or given series consequently only a potential progression is cogitated
hence when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned reason is compelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line as completed and given in their totality
but if the very same condition is considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions which together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in a descending line reason may preserve a perfect indifference as to how far this progression may extend a parte posteriori and whether the totality of this series is possible because it stands in no need of such a series for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it inasmuch as this conclusion is sufficiently guaranteed and determined on grounds a parte priori
it may be the case that upon the side of the conditions the series of premisses has a first or highest condition or it may not possess this and so be a parte priori unlimited but it must nevertheless contain totality of conditions even admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehending it and the whole series must be unconditionally true if the conditioned which is considered as an inference resulting from it is to be held as true
this is a requirement of reason which announces its cognition as determined priori and as necessary either in itselfand in this case it needs no grounds to rest uponor if it is deduced as a member of a series of grounds which is itself unconditionally true
section iii
system of transcendental ideas
we are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic which makes complete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at unveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms
our subject is transcendental dialectic which must contain completely priori the origin of certain cognitions drawn from pure reason and the origin of certain deduced conceptions the object of which cannot be given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of the faculty of understanding
we have observed from the natural relation which the transcendental use of our cognition in syllogisms as well as in judgements must have to the logical that there are three kinds of dialectical arguments corresponding to the three modes of conclusion by which reason attains to cognitions on principles and that in all it is the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis beyond which the understanding never proceeds to the unconditioned which the understanding never can reach
now the most general relations which can exist in our representations are st the relation to the subject nd the relation to objects either as phenomena or as objects of thought in general
if we connect this subdivision with the main division all the relations of our representations of which we can form either a conception or an idea are threefold
the relation to the subject
the relation to the manifold of the object as a phenomenon
the relation to all things in general
now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical unity of representations conceptions of pure reason transcendental ideas on the other hand with the unconditional synthetical unity of all conditions
it follows that all transcendental ideas arrange themselves in three classes the first of which contains the absolute unconditioned unity of the thinking subject the second the absolute unity of the series of the conditions of a phenomenon the third the absolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general
the thinking subject is the objectmatter of psychology the sum total of all phenomena the world is the objectmatter of cosmology and the thing which contains the highest condition of the possibility of all that is cogitable the being of all beings is the objectmatter of all theology
thus pure reason presents us with the idea of a transcendental doctrine of the soul psychologia rationalis of a transcendental science of the world cosmologia rationalis and finally of a transcendental doctrine of god theologia transcendentalis
understanding cannot originate even the outline of any of these sciences even when connected with the highest logical use of reason that is all cogitable syllogismsfor the purpose of proceeding from one object phenomenon to all others even to the utmost limits of the empirical synthesis
they are on the contrary pure and genuine products or problems of pure reason
what modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas are will be fully exposed in the following chapter
they follow the guiding thread of the categories
for pure reason never relates immediately to objects but to the conceptions of these contained in the understanding
in like manner it will be made manifest in the detailed explanation of these ideashow reason merely through the synthetical use of the same function which it employs in a categorical syllogism necessarily attains to the conception of the absolute unity of the thinking subjecthow the logical procedure in hypothetical ideas necessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in a series of given conditions and finallyhow the mere form of the disjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of all beings a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degree paradoxical
an objective deduction such as we were able to present in the case of the categories is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas
for they have in truth no relation to any object in experience for the very reason that they are only ideas
but a subjective deduction of them from the nature of our reason is possible and has been given in the present chapter
it is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute totality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions and that it does not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the part of the conditioned
for of the former alone does she stand in need in order to preposit the whole series of conditions and thus present them to the understanding priori
but if we once have a completely and unconditionally given condition there is no further necessity in proceeding with the series for a conception of reason for the understanding takes of itself every step downward from the condition to the conditioned
thus the transcendental ideas are available only for ascending in the series of conditions till we reach the unconditioned that is principles
as regards descending to the conditioned on the other hand we find that there is a widely extensive logical use which reason makes of the laws of the understanding but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible and that when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis for example of the whole series of all future changes in the world this idea is a mere ens rationis an arbitrary fiction of thought and not a necessary presupposition of reason
for the possibility of the conditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions but not of its consequences
consequently this conception is not a transcendental ideaand it is with these alone that we are at present occupied
finally it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas a certain connection and unity and that pure reason by means of them collects all its cognitions into one system
from the cognition of self to the cognition of the world and through these to the supreme being the progression is so natural that it seems to resemble the logical march of reason from the premisses to the conclusion
now whether there lies unobserved at the foundation of these ideas an analogy of the same kind as exists between the logical and transcendental procedure of reason is another of those questions the answer to which we must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage in our inquiries
in this cursory and preliminary view we have meanwhile reached our aim
for we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached to the transcendental conceptions of reason from their being commonly mixed up with other conceptions in the systems of philosophers and not properly distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding we have exposed their origin and thereby at the same time their determinate number and presented them in a systematic connection and have thus marked out and enclosed a definite sphere for pure reason
the science of metaphysics has for the proper object of its inquiries only three grand ideas god freedom and immortality and it aims at showing that the second conception conjoined with the first must lead to the third as a necessary conclusion
all the other subjects with which it occupies itself are merely means for the attainment and realization of these ideas
it does not require these ideas for the construction of a science of nature but on the contrary for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature
a complete insight into and comprehension of them would render theology ethics and through the conjunction of both religion solely dependent on the speculative faculty of reason
in a systematic representation of these ideas the abovementioned arrangementthe synthetical onewould be the most suitable but in the investigation which must necessarily precede it the analytical which reverses this arrangement would be better adapted to our purpose as in it we should proceed from that which experience immediately presents to uspsychology to cosmology and thence to theology
transcendental dialecticbook iiof the dialectical procedure of pure reason
it may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is something of which we have no conception although the idea may be a necessary product of reason according to its original laws
for in fact a conception of an object that is adequate to the idea given by reason is impossible
for such an object must be capable of being presented and intuited in a possible experience
but we should express our meaning better and with less risk of being misunderstood if we said that we can have no knowledge of an object which perfectly corresponds to an idea although we may possess a problematical conception thereof
now the transcendental subjective reality at least of the pure conceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas by a necessary procedure of reason
there must therefore be syllogisms which contain no empirical premisses and by means of which we conclude from something that we do know to something of which we do not even possess a conception to which we nevertheless by an unavoidable illusion ascribe objective reality
such arguments are as regards their result rather to be termed sophisms than syllogisms although indeed as regards their origin they are very well entitled to the latter name inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental products of reason but are necessitated by its very nature
they are sophisms not of men but of pure reason herself from which the wisest cannot free himself
after long labour he may be able to guard against the error but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which continually mocks and misleads him
of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds corresponding to the number of the ideas which their conclusions present
in the argument or syllogism of the first class i conclude from the transcendental conception of the subject contains no manifold the absolute unity of the subject itself of which i cannot in this manner attain to a conception
this dialectical argument i shall call the transcendental paralogism
the second class of sophistical arguments is occupied with the transcendental conception of the absolute totality of the series of conditions for a given phenomenon and i conclude from the fact that i have always a selfcontradictory conception of the unconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon one side the truth of the opposite unity of which i have nevertheless no conception
the condition of reason in these dialectical arguments i shall term the antinomy of pure reason
finally according to the third kind of sophistical argument i conclude from the totality of the conditions of thinking objects in general in so far as they can be given the absolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the possibility of things in general that is from things which i do not know in their mere transcendental conception i conclude a being of all beings which i know still less by means of a transcendental conception and of whose unconditioned necessity i can form no conception whatever
this dialectical argument i shall call the ideal of pure reason
chapter i
of the paralogisms of pure reason
the logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in respect of its form be the content what it may
but a transcendental paralogism has a transcendental foundation and concludes falsely while the form is correct and unexceptionable
in this manner the paralogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason and is the parent of an unavoidable though not insoluble mental illusion
we now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list of transcendental conceptions and yet must be reckoned with them but at the same time without in the least altering or indicating a deficiency in that table
this is the conception or if the term is preferred the judgement i think
but it is readily perceived that this thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general and consequently of transcendental conceptions also and that it is therefore regarded as a transcendental conception although it can have no peculiar claim to be so ranked inasmuch as its only use is to indicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness
at the same time pure as this conception is from empirical content impressions of the senses it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of objects
i as thinking am an object of the internal sense and am called soul
that which is an object of the external senses is called body
thus the expression i as a thinking being designates the objectmatter of psychology which may be called the rational doctrine of the soul inasmuch as in this science i desire to know nothing of the soul but what independently of all experience which determines me in concreto may be concluded from this conception i in so far as it appears in all thought
now the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of this kind
for if the smallest empirical element of thought if any particular perception of my internal state were to be introduced among the grounds of cognition of this science it would not be a rational but an empirical doctrine of the soul
we have thus before us a pretended science raised upon the single proposition i think whose foundation or want of foundation we may very properly and agreeably with the nature of a transcendental philosophy here examine
it ought not to be objected that in this proposition which expresses the perception of ones self an internal experience is asserted and that consequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is founded upon it is not pure but partly founded upon an empirical principle
for this internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception i think which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions possible in which we say i think substance cause etc
for internal experience in general and its possibility or perception in general and its relation to other perceptions unless some particular distinction or determination thereof is empirically given cannot be regarded as empirical cognition but as cognition of the empirical and belongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience which is certainly transcendental
the smallest object of experience for example only pleasure or pain that should be included in the general representation of selfconsciousness would immediately change the rational into an empirical psychology
i think is therefore the only text of rational psychology from which it must develop its whole system
it is manifest that this thought when applied to an object myself can contain nothing but transcendental predicates thereof because the least empirical predicate would destroy the purity of the science and its independence of all experience
but we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categoriesonly as in the present case a thing i as thinking being is at first given we shallnot indeed change the order of the categories as it stands in the tablebut begin at the category of substance by which at the a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through the series
the topic of the rational doctrine of the soul from which everything else it may contain must be deduced is accordingly as follows
the soul is substance as regards its quality it is simple
as regards the different times in which it exists it is numerically identical that is unity not plurality
it is in relation to possible objects in space
the reader who may not so easily perceive the psychological sense of these expressions taken here in their transcendental abstraction and cannot guess why the latter attribute of the soul belongs to the category of existence will find the expressions sufficiently explained and justified in the sequel
i have moreover to apologize for the latin terms which have been employed instead of their german synonyms contrary to the rules of correct writing
but i judged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity
from these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology by combination alone without the aid of any other principle
this substance merely as an object of the internal sense gives the conception of immateriality as simple substance that of incorruptibility its identity as intellectual substance gives the conception of personality all these three together spirituality
its relation to objects in space gives us the conception of connection commercium with bodies
thus it represents thinking substance as the principle of life in matter that is as a soul anima and as the ground of animality and this limited and determined by the conception of spirituality gives us that of immortality
now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental psychology which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason touching the nature of our thinking being
we can however lay at the foundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itself perfectly contentless representation i which cannot even be called a conception but merely a consciousness which accompanies all conceptions
by this i or he or it who or which thinks nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought x which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its predicates and of which apart from these we cannot form the least conception
hence in a perpetual circle inasmuch as we must always employ it in order to frame any judgement respecting it
and this inconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of because consciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing a particular object as a form of representation in general in so far as it may be termed cognition for in and by cognition alone do i think anything
it must however appear extraordinary at first sight that the condition under which i think and which is consequently a property of my subject should be held to be likewise valid for every existence which thinks and that we can presume to base upon a seemingly empirical proposition a judgement which is apodeictic and universal to wit that everything which thinks is constituted as the voice of my consciousness declares it to be that is as a selfconscious being
the cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily attribute to things priori all the properties which constitute conditions under which alone we can cogitate them
now i cannot obtain the least representation of a thinking being by means of external experience but solely through selfconsciousness
such objects are consequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness of mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking beings
the proposition i think is in the present case understood in a problematical sense not in so far as it contains a perception of an existence like the cartesian cogito ergo sum but in regard to its mere possibilityfor the purpose of discovering what properties may be inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject of it
if at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings there lay more than the mere cogitoif we could likewise call in aid observations on the play of our thoughts and the thence derived natural laws of the thinking self there would arise an empirical psychology which would be a kind of physiology of the internal sense and might possibly be capable of explaining the phenomena of that sense
but it could never be available for discovering those properties which do not belong to possible experience such as the quality of simplicity nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on the nature of thinking beings it would therefore not be a rational psychology
now as the proposition i think in the problematical sense contains the form of every judgement in general and is the constant accompaniment of all the categories it is manifest that conclusions are drawn from it only by a transcendental employment of the understanding
this use of the understanding excludes all empirical elements and we cannot as has been shown above have any favourable conception beforehand of its procedure
we shall therefore follow with a critical eye this proposition through all the predicaments of pure psychology but we shall for brevitys sake allow this examination to proceed in an uninterrupted connection
before entering on this task however the following general remark may help to quicken our attention to this mode of argument
it is not merely through my thinking that i cognize an object but only through my determining a given intuition in relation to the unity of consciousness in which all thinking consists
it follows that i cognize myself not through my being conscious of myself as thinking but only when i am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined in relation to the function of thought
all the modi of selfconsciousness in thought are hence not conceptions of objects conceptions of the understandingcategories they are mere logical functions which do not present to thought an object to be cognized and cannot therefore present my self as an object
not the consciousness of the determining but only that of the determinable self that is of my internal intuition in so far as the manifold contained in it can be connected conformably with the general condition of the unity of apperception in thought is the object
in all judgements i am the determining subject of that relation which constitutes a judgement
but that the i which thinks must be considered as in thought always a subject and as a thing which cannot be a predicate to thought is an apodeictic and identical proposition
but this proposition does not signify that i as an object am for myself a selfsubsistent being or substance
this latter statementan ambitious onerequires to be supported by data which are not to be discovered in thought and are perhaps in so far as i consider the thinking self merely as such not to be discovered in the thinking self at all
that the i or ego of apperception and consequently in all thought is singular or simple and cannot be resolved into a plurality of subjects and therefore indicates a logically simple subjectthis is selfevident from the very conception of an ego and is consequently an analytical proposition
but this is not tantamount to declaring that the thinking ego is a simple substancefor this would be a synthetical proposition
the conception of substance always relates to intuitions which with me cannot be other than sensuous and which consequently lie completely out of the sphere of the understanding and its thought but to this sphere belongs the affirmation that the ego is simple in thought
it would indeed be surprising if the conception of substance which in other cases requires so much labour to distinguish from the other elements presented by intuitionso much trouble too to discover whether it can be simple as in the case of the parts of mattershould be presented immediately to me as if by revelation in the poorest mental representation of all
the proposition of the identity of my self amidst all the manifold representations of which i am conscious is likewise a proposition lying in the conceptions themselves and is consequently analytical
but this identity of the subject of which i am conscious in all its representations does not relate to or concern the intuition of the subject by which it is given as an object
this proposition cannot therefore enounce the identity of the person by which is understood the consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinking being in all change and variation of circumstances
to prove this we should require not a mere analysis of the proposition but synthetical judgements based upon a given intuition
i distinguish my own existence as that of a thinking being from that of other things external to meamong which my body also is reckoned
this is also an analytical proposition for other things are exactly those which i think as different or distinguished from myself
but whether this consciousness of myself is possible without things external to me and whether therefore i can exist merely as a thinking being without being mancannot be known or inferred from this proposition
thus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself as object by the analysis of the consciousness of my self in thought
the logical exposition of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysical determination of the object
our critique would be an investigation utterly superfluous if there existed a possibility of proving priori that all thinking beings are in themselves simple substances as such therefore possess the inseparable attribute of personality and are conscious of their existence apart from and unconnected with matter
for we should thus have taken a step beyond the world of sense and have penetrated into the sphere of noumena and in this case the right could not be denied us of extending our knowledge in this sphere of establishing ourselves and under a favouring star appropriating to ourselves possessions in it
for the proposition every thinking being as such is simple substance is an priori synthetical proposition because in the first place it goes beyond the conception which is the subject of it and adds to the mere notion of a thinking being the mode of its existence and in the second place annexes a predicate that of simplicity to the latter conceptiona predicate which it could not have discovered in the sphere of experience
it would follow that priori synthetical propositions are possible and legitimate not only as we have maintained in relation to objects of possible experience and as principles of the possibility of this experience itself but are applicable to things in themselvesan inference which makes an end of the whole of this critique and obliges us to fall back on the old mode of metaphysical procedure
but indeed the danger is not so great if we look a little closer into the question
there lurks in the procedure of rational psychology a paralogism which is represented in the following syllogism
that which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject does not exist otherwise than as subject and is therefore substance
a thinking being considered merely as such cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject
therefore it exists also as such that is as substance
in the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and in every relation consequently as it may be given in intuition
but in the minor we speak of the same being only in so far as it regards itself as subject relatively to thought and the unity of consciousness but not in relation to intuition by which it is presented as an object to thought
thus the conclusion is here arrived at by a sophisma figurae dictionis
thought is taken in the two premisses in two totally different senses
in the major it is considered as relating and applying to objects in general consequently to objects of intuition also
in the minor we understand it as relating merely to selfconsciousness
in this sense we do not cogitate an object but merely the relation to the selfconsciousness of the subject as the form of thought
in the former premiss we speak of things which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subjects
in the second we do not speak of things but of thought all objects being abstracted in which the ego is always the subject of consciousness
hence the conclusion cannot be i cannot exist otherwise than as subject but only i can in cogitating my existence employ my ego only as the subject of the judgement
but this is an identical proposition and throws no light on the mode of my existence
that this famous argument is a mere paralogism will be plain to any one who will consider the general remark which precedes our exposition of the principles of the pure understanding and the section on noumena
for it was there proved that the conception of a thing which can exist per seonly as a subject and never as a predicate possesses no objective reality that is to say we can never know whether there exists any object to correspond to the conception consequently the conception is nothing more than a conception and from it we derive no proper knowledge
if this conception is to indicate by the term substance an object that can be given if it is to become a cognition we must have at the foundation of the cognition a permanent intuition as the indispensable condition of its objective reality
for through intuition alone can an object be given
but in internal intuition there is nothing permanent for the ego is but the consciousness of my thought
if then we appeal merely to thought we cannot discover the necessary condition of the application of the conception of substancethat is of a subject existing per seto the subject as a thinking being
and thus the conception of the simple nature of substance which is connected with the objective reality of this conception is shown to be also invalid and to be in fact nothing more than the logical qualitative unity of selfconsciousness in thought whilst we remain perfectly ignorant whether the subject is composite or not
refutation of the argument of mendelssohn for the substantiality or permanence of the soul
this acute philosopher easily perceived the insufficiency of the common argument which attempts to prove that the soulit being granted that it is a simple beingcannot perish by dissolution or decomposition he saw it is not impossible for it to cease to be by extinction or disappearance
he endeavoured to prove in his phaedo that the soul cannot be annihilated by showing that a simple being cannot cease to exist
inasmuch as he said a simple existence cannot diminish nor gradually lose portions of its being and thus be by degrees reduced to nothing for it possesses no parts and therefore no multiplicity between the moment in which it is and the moment in which it is not no time can be discoveredwhich is impossible
but this philosopher did not consider that granting the soul to possess this simple nature which contains no parts external to each other and consequently no extensive quantity we cannot refuse to it any less than to any other being intensive quantity that is a degree of reality in regard to all its faculties nay to all that constitutes its existence
but this degree of reality can become less and less through an infinite series of smaller degrees
it follows therefore that this supposed substancethis thing the permanence of which is not assured in any other way may if not by decomposition by gradual loss remissio of its powers consequently by elanguescence if i may employ this expression be changed into nothing
for consciousness itself has always a degree which may be lessened
consequently the faculty of being conscious may be diminished and so with all other faculties
the permanence of the soul therefore as an object of the internal sense remains undemonstrated nay even indemonstrable
its permanence in life is evident per se inasmuch as the thinking being as man is to itself at the same time an object of the external senses
but this does not authorize the rational psychologist to affirm from mere conceptions its permanence beyond life
clearness is not as logicians maintain the consciousness of a representation
for a certain degree of consciousness which may not however be sufficient for recollection is to be met with in many dim representations
for without any consciousness at all we should not be able to recognize any difference in the obscure representations we connect as we really can do with many conceptions such as those of right and justice and those of the musician who strikes at once several notes in improvising a piece of music
but a representation is clear in which our consciousness is sufficient for the consciousness of the difference of this representation from others
if we are only conscious that there is a difference but are not conscious of the differencethat is what the difference isthe representation must be termed obscure
there is consequently an infinite series of degrees of consciousness down to its entire disappearance
there are some who think they have done enough to establish a new possibility in the mode of the existence of souls when they have shown that there is no contradiction in their hypotheses on this subject
such are those who affirm the possibility of thoughtof which they have no other knowledge than what they derive from its use in connecting empirical intuitions presented in this our human lifeafter this life has ceased
but it is very easy to embarrass them by the introduction of counterpossibilities which rest upon quite as good a foundation
such for example is the possibility of the division of a simple substance into several substances and conversely of the coalition of several into one simple substance
for although divisibility presupposes composition it does not necessarily require a composition of substances but only of the degrees of the several faculties of one and the same substance
now we can cogitate all the powers and faculties of the souleven that of consciousnessas diminished by one half the substance still remaining
in the same way we can represent to ourselves without contradiction this obliterated half as preserved not in the soul but without it and we can believe that as in this case every thing that is real in the soul and has a degreeconsequently its entire existencehas been halved a particular substance would arise out of the soul
for the multiplicity which has been divided formerly existed but not as a multiplicity of substances but of every reality as the quantum of existence in it and the unity of substance was merely a mode of existence which by this division alone has been transformed into a plurality of subsistence
in the same manner several simple substances might coalesce into one without anything being lost except the plurality of subsistence inasmuch as the one substance would contain the degree of reality of all the former substances
perhaps indeed the simple substances which appear under the form of matter might not indeed by a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other but by an unknown influence of which the former would be but the phenomenal appearance by means of such a dynamical division of the parentsouls as intensive quantities produce other souls while the former repaired the loss thus sustained with new matter of the same sort
i am far from allowing any value to such chimeras and the principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an empirical use of the categoriesthat of substance for exampleis possible
but if the rationalist is bold enough to construct on the mere authority of the faculty of thoughtwithout any intuition whereby an object is givena selfsubsistent being merely because the unity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a composite being instead of declaring as he ought to do that he is unable to explain the possibility of a thinking nature what ought to hinder the materialist with as complete an independence of experience to employ the principle of the rationalist in a directly opposite mannerstill preserving the formal unity required by his opponent
if now we take the above propositionsas they must be accepted as valid for all thinking beings in the system of rational psychologyin synthetical connection and proceed from the category of relation with the proposition all thinking beings are as such substances backwards through the series till the circle is completed we come at last to their existence of which in this system of rational psychology substances are held to be conscious independently of external things nay it is asserted that in relation to the permanence which is a necessary characteristic of substance they can of themselves determine external things
it follows that idealismat least problematical idealism is perfectly unavoidable in this rationalistic system
and if the existence of outward things is not held to be requisite to the determination of the existence of a substance in time the existence of these outward things at all is a gratuitous assumption which remains without the possibility of a proof
but if we proceed analyticallythe i think as a proposition containing in itself an existence as given consequently modality being the principleand dissect this proposition in order to ascertain its content and discover whether and how this ego determines its existence in time and space without the aid of anything external the propositions of rationalistic psychology would not begin with the conception of a thinking being but with a reality and the properties of a thinking being in general would be deduced from the mode in which this reality is cogitated after everything empirical had been abstracted as is shown in the following table
i think
as subject as simple subject
as identical subject in every state of my thought
now inasmuch as it is not determined in this second proposition whether i can exist and be cogitated only as subject and not also as a predicate of another being the conception of a subject is here taken in a merely logical sense and it remains undetermined whether substance is to be cogitated under the conception or not
but in the third proposition the absolute unity of apperceptionthe simple ego in the representation to which all connection and separation which constitute thought relate is of itself important even although it presents us with no information about the constitution or subsistence of the subject
apperception is something real and the simplicity of its nature is given in the very fact of its possibility
now in space there is nothing real that is at the same time simple for points which are the only simple things in space are merely limits but not constituent parts of space
from this follows the impossibility of a definition on the basis of materialism of the constitution of my ego as a merely thinking subject
but because my existence is considered in the first proposition as given for it does not mean every thinking being exists for this would be predicating of them absolute necessity but only i exist thinking the proposition is quite empirical and contains the determinability of my existence merely in relation to my representations in time
but as i require for this purpose something that is permanent such as is not given in internal intuition the mode of my existence whether as substance or as accident cannot be determined by means of this simple selfconsciousness
thus if materialism is inadequate to explain the mode in which i exist spiritualism is likewise as insufficient and the conclusion is that we are utterly unable to attain to any knowledge of the constitution of the soul in so far as relates to the possibility of its existence apart from external objects
and indeed how should it be possible merely by the aid of the unity of consciousnesswhich we cognize only for the reason that it is indispensable to the possibility of experienceto pass the bounds of experience our existence in this life and to extend our cognition to the nature of all thinking beings by means of the empiricalbut in relation to every sort of intuition perfectly undeterminedproposition i think
there does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrine furnishing any addition to our knowledge of ourselves
it is nothing more than a discipline which sets impassable limits to speculative reason in this region of thought to prevent it on the one hand from throwing itself into the arms of a soulless materialism and on the other from losing itself in the mazes of a baseless spiritualism
it teaches us to consider this refusal of our reason to give any satisfactory answer to questions which reach beyond the limits of this our human life as a hint to abandon fruitless speculation and to direct to a practical use our knowledge of ourselveswhich although applicable only to objects of experience receives its principles from a higher source and regulates its procedure as if our destiny reached far beyond the boundaries of experience and life
from all this it is evident that rational psychology has its origin in a mere misunderstanding
the unity of consciousness which lies at the basis of the categories is considered to be an intuition of the subject as an object and the category of substance is applied to the intuition
but this unity is nothing more than the unity in thought by which no object is given to which therefore the category of substancewhich always presupposes a given intuitioncannot be applied
consequently the subject cannot be cognized
the subject of the categories cannot therefore for the very reason that it cogitates these frame any conception of itself as an object of the categories for to cogitate these it must lay at the foundation its own pure selfconsciousnessthe very thing that it wishes to explain and describe
in like manner the subject in which the representation of time has its basis cannot determine for this very reason its own existence in time
now if the latter is impossible the former as an attempt to determine itself by means of the categories as a thinking being in general is no less so
the i think is as has been already stated an empirical proposition and contains the proposition i exist
but i cannot say everything which thinks exists for in this case the property of thought would constitute all beings possessing it necessary beings
hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from the proposition i think as descartes maintainedbecause in this case the major premiss everything which thinks exists must precedebut the two propositions are identical
the proposition i think expresses an undetermined empirical intuition that perception proving consequently that sensation which must belong to sensibility lies at the foundation of this proposition but it precedes experience whose province it is to determine an object of perception by means of the categories in relation to time and existence in this proposition is not a category as it does not apply to an undetermined given object but only to one of which we have a conception and about which we wish to know whether it does or does not exist out of and apart from this conception
an undetermined perception signifies here merely something real that has been given only however to thought in generalbut not as a phenomenon nor as a thing in itself noumenon but only as something that really exists and is designated as such in the proposition i think
for it must be remarked that when i call the proposition i think an empirical proposition i do not thereby mean that the ego in the proposition is an empirical representation on the contrary it is purely intellectual because it belongs to thought in general
but without some empirical representation which presents to the mind material for thought the mental act i think would not take place and the empirical is only the condition of the application or employment of the pure intellectual faculty
thus then appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognition which is to extend its rule beyond the limits of experiencea cognition which is one of the highest interests of humanity and thus is proved the futility of the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region of thought
but in this interest of thought the severity of criticism has rendered to reason a not unimportant service by the demonstration of the impossibility of making any dogmatical affirmation concerning an object of experience beyond the boundaries of experience
she has thus fortified reason against all affirmations of the contrary
now this can be accomplished in only two ways
either our proposition must be proved apodeictically or if this is unsuccessful the sources of this inability must be sought for and if these are discovered to exist in the natural and necessary limitation of our reason our opponents must submit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancing claims to dogmatic assertion
but the right say rather the necessity to admit a future life upon principles of the practical conjoined with the speculative use of reason has lost nothing by this renunciation for the merely speculative proof has never had any influence upon the common reason of men
it stands upon the point of a hair so that even the schools have been able to preserve it from falling only by incessantly discussing it and spinning it like a top and even in their eyes it has never been able to present any safe foundation for the erection of a theory
the proofs which have been current among men preserve their value undiminished nay rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power by the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason
for reason is thus confined within her own peculiar provincethe arrangement of ends or aims which is at the same time the arrangement of nature and as a practical faculty without limiting itself to the latter it is justified in extending the former and with it our own existence beyond the boundaries of experience and life
if we turn our attention to the analogy of the nature of living beings in this world in the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept as a principle that no organ no faculty no appetite is useless and that nothing is superfluous nothing disproportionate to its use nothing unsuited to its end but that on the contrary everything is perfectly conformed to its destination in lifewe shall find that man who alone is the final end and aim of this order is still the only animal that seems to be excepted from it
for his natural giftsnot merely as regards the talents and motives that may incite him to employ them but especially the moral law in himstretch so far beyond all mere earthly utility and advantage that he feels himself bound to prize the mere consciousness of probity apart from all advantageous consequenceseven the shadowy gift of posthumous fameabove everything and he is conscious of an inward call to constitute himself by his conduct in this worldwithout regard to mere sublunary intereststhe citizen of a better
this mighty irresistible proofaccompanied by an everincreasing knowledge of the conformability to a purpose in everything we see around us by the conviction of the boundless immensity of creation by the consciousness of a certain illimitableness in the possible extension of our knowledge and by a desire commensurate therewithremains to humanity even after the theoretical cognition of ourselves has failed to establish the necessity of an existence after death
conclusion of the solution of the psychological paralogism
the dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our confounding an idea of reason of a pure intelligence with the conceptionin every respect undeterminedof a thinking being in general
i cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience at the same time making abstraction of all actual experience and infer therefrom that i can be conscious of myself apart from experience and its empirical conditions
i consequently confound the possible abstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposed consciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self and i believe that i cognize what is substantial in myself as a transcendental subject when i have nothing more in thought than the unity of consciousness which lies at the basis of all determination of cognition
the task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not properly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking because it proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart from this communion after death and is therefore transcendent in the proper sense of the word although occupying itself with an object of experienceonly in so far however as it ceases to be an object of experience
but a sufficient answer may be found to the question in our system
the difficulty which lies in the execution of this task consists as is well known in the presupposed heterogeneity of the object of the internal sense the soul and the objects of the external senses inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one is time and of that of the other space also
but if we consider that both kinds of objects do not differ internally but only in so far as the one appears externally to the otherconsequently that what lies at the basis of phenomena as a thing in itself may not be heterogeneous this difficulty disappears
there then remains no other difficulty than is to be found in the questionhow a community of substances is possible a question which lies out of the region of psychology and which the reader after what in our analytic has been said of primitive forces and faculties will easily judge to be also beyond the region of human cognition
general remark
on the transition from rational psychology to cosmology
the proposition i think or i exist thinking is an empirical proposition
but such a proposition must be based on empirical intuition and the object cogitated as a phenomenon and thus our theory appears to maintain that the soul even in thought is merely a phenomenon and in this way our consciousness itself in fact abuts upon nothing
thought per se is merely the purely spontaneous logical function which operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition and it does not represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenonfor this reason alone that it pays no attention to the question whether the mode of intuiting it is sensuous or intellectual
i therefore do not represent myself in thought either as i am or as i appear to myself i merely cogitate myself as an object in general of the mode of intuiting which i make abstraction
when i represent myself as the subject of thought or as the ground of thought these modes of representation are not related to the categories of substance or of cause for these are functions of thought applicable only to our sensuous intuition
the application of these categories to the ego would however be necessary if i wished to make myself an object of knowledge
but i wish to be conscious of myself only as thinking in what mode my self is given in intuition i do not consider and it may be that i who think am a phenomenonalthough not in so far as i am a thinking being but in the consciousness of myself in mere thought i am a being though this consciousness does not present to me any property of this being as material for thought
but the proposition i think in so far as it declares i exist thinking is not the mere representation of a logical function
it determines the subject which is in this case an object also in relation to existence and it cannot be given without the aid of the internal sense whose intuition presents to us an object not as a thing in itself but always as a phenomenon
in this proposition there is therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity of thought there is also the receptivity of intuition that is my thought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself
now in this intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of the employment of its logical functions as categories of substance cause and so forth not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as an object in itself by means of the representation i but also for the purpose of determining the mode of its existence that is of cognizing itself as noumenon
but this is impossible for the internal empirical intuition is sensuous and presents us with nothing but phenomenal data which do not assist the object of pure consciousness in its attempt to cognize itself as a separate existence but are useful only as contributions to experience
but let it be granted that we could discover not in experience but in certain firmlyestablished priori laws of the use of pure reasonlaws relating to our existence authority to consider ourselves as legislating priori in relation to our own existence and as determining this existence we should on this supposition find ourselves possessed of a spontaneity by which our actual existence would be determinable without the aid of the conditions of empirical intuition
we should also become aware that in the consciousness of our existence there was an priori content which would serve to determine our own existencean existence only sensuously determinablerelatively however to a certain internal faculty in relation to an intelligible world
but this would not give the least help to the attempts of rational psychology
for this wonderful faculty which the consciousness of the moral law in me reveals would present me with a principle of the determination of my own existence which is purely intellectualbut by what predicates by none other than those which are given in sensuous intuition
thus i should find myself in the same position in rational psychology which i formerly occupied that is to say i should find myself still in need of sensuous intuitions in order to give significance to my conceptions of substance and cause by means of which alone i can possess a knowledge of myself but these intuitions can never raise me above the sphere of experience
i should be justified however in applying these conceptions in regard to their practical use which is always directed to objects of experiencein conformity with their analogical significance when employed theoreticallyto freedom and its subject
at the same time i should understand by them merely the logical functions of subject and predicate of principle and consequence in conformity with which all actions are so determined that they are capable of being explained along with the laws of nature conformably to the categories of substance and cause although they originate from a very different principle
we have made these observations for the purpose of guarding against misunderstanding to which the doctrine of our intuition of self as a phenomenon is exposed
we shall have occasion to perceive their utility in the sequel
chapter ii
the antinomy of pure reason
we showed in the introduction to this part of our work that all transcendental illusion of pure reason arose from dialectical arguments the schema of which logic gives us in its three formal species of syllogismsjust as the categories find their logical schema in the four functions of all judgements
the first kind of these sophistical arguments related to the unconditioned unity of the subjective conditions of all representations in general of the subject or soul in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms the major of which as the principle enounces the relation of a predicate to a subject
the second kind of dialectical argument will therefore be concerned following the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms with the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions in the phenomenon and in this way the theme of the third kind to be treated of in the following chapter will be the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general
but it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism produced in the mind only a onethird illusion in regard to the idea of the subject of our thought and the conceptions of reason gave no ground to maintain the contrary proposition
the advantage is completely on the side of pneumatism although this theory itself passes into naught in the crucible of pure reason
very different is the case when we apply reason to the objective synthesis of phenomena
here certainly reason establishes with much plausibility its principle of unconditioned unity but it very soon falls into such contradictions that it is compelled in relation to cosmology to renounce its pretensions
for here a new phenomenon of human reason meets usa perfectly natural antithetic which does not require to be sought for by subtle sophistry but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls
it is thereby preserved to be sure from the slumber of a fancied convictionwhich a merely onesided illusion produces but it is at the same time compelled either on the one hand to abandon itself to a despairing scepticism or on the other to assume a dogmatical confidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions without granting a fair hearing to the other side of the question
either is the death of a sound philosophy although the former might perhaps deserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason
before entering this region of discord and confusion which the conflict of the laws of pure reason antinomy produces we shall present the reader with some considerations in explanation and justification of the method we intend to follow in our treatment of this subject
i term all transcendental ideas in so far as they relate to the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena cosmical conceptions partly on account of this unconditioned totality on which the conception of the worldwhole is baseda conception which is itself an ideapartly because they relate solely to the synthesis of phenomenathe empirical synthesis while on the other hand the absolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible things gives rise to an ideal of pure reason which is quite distinct from the cosmical conception although it stands in relation with it
hence as the paralogisms of pure reason laid the foundation for a dialectical psychology the antinomy of pure reason will present us with the transcendental principles of a pretended pure rational cosmologynot however to declare it valid and to appropriate it butas the very term of a conflict of reason sufficiently indicates to present it as an idea which cannot be reconciled with phenomena and experience
section i
system of cosmological ideas
that we may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideas according to a principle we must remark in the first place that it is from the understanding alone that pure and transcendental conceptions take their origin that the reason does not properly give birth to any conception but only frees the conception of the understanding from the unavoidable limitation of a possible experience and thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical though it must still be in connection with it
this happens from the fact that for a given conditioned reason demands absolute totality on the side of the conditions to which the understanding submits all phenomena and thus makes of the category a transcendental idea
this it does that it may be able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis by continuing it to the unconditioned which is not to be found in experience but only in the idea
reason requires this according to the principle if the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions and consequently the absolutely unconditioned is also given whereby alone the former was possible
first then the transcendental ideas are properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned and they may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter
but secondly all the categories are not available for this purpose but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a seriesof conditions subordinated to not coordinated with each other
absolute totality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascending series of the conditions of a conditioned not consequently when the question relates to the descending series of consequences or to the aggregate of the coordinated conditions of these consequences
for in relation to a given conditioned conditions are presupposed and considered to be given along with it
on the other hand as the consequences do not render possible their conditions but rather presuppose themin the consideration of the procession of consequences or in the descent from the given condition to the conditioned we may be quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not and their totality is not a necessary demand of reason
thus we cogitateand necessarilya given time completely elapsed up to a given moment although that time is not determinable by us
but as regards time future which is not the condition of arriving at the present in order to conceive it it is quite indifferent whether we consider future time as ceasing at some point or as prolonging itself to infinity
take for example the series m n o in which n is given as conditioned in relation to m but at the same time as the condition of o and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m l k i etc
and also downwards from the condition n to the conditioned o p q r etc
i must presuppose the former series to be able to consider n as given and n is according to reason the totality of conditions possible only by means of that series
but its possibility does not rest on the following series o p q r which for this reason cannot be regarded as given but only as capable of being given dabilis
i shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the conditionsfrom that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more remoteregressive that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned from the immediate consequence to the more remote i shall call the progressive synthesis
the former proceeds in antecedentia the latter in consequentia
the cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the totality of the regressive synthesis and proceed in antecedentia not in consequentia
when the latter takes place it is an arbitrary and not a necessary problem of pure reason for we require for the complete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon not the consequences which succeed but the grounds or principles which precede
in order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the table of categories we take first the two primitive quanta of all our intuitions time and space
time is in itself a series and the formal condition of all series and hence in relation to a given present we must distinguish priori in it the antecedentia as conditions time past from the consequentia time future
consequently the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned relates merely to all past time
according to the idea of reason the whole past time as the condition of the given moment is necessarily cogitated as given
but as regards space there exists in it no distinction between progressus and regressus for it is an aggregate and not a seriesits parts existing together at the same time
i can consider a given point of time in relation to past time only as conditioned because this given moment comes into existence only through the past time rather through the passing of the preceding time
but as the parts of space are not subordinated but coordinated to each other one part cannot be the condition of the possibility of the other and space is not in itself like time a series
but the synthesis of the manifold parts of spacethe syntheses whereby we apprehend spaceis nevertheless successive it takes place therefore in time and contains a series
and as in this series of aggregated spaces for example the feet in a rood beginning with a given portion of space those which continue to be annexed form the condition of the limits of the formerthe measurement of a space must also be regarded as a synthesis of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned
it differs however in this respect from that of time that the side of the conditioned is not in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition and consequently regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical
but inasmuch as one part of space is not given but only limited by and through another we must also consider every limited space as conditioned in so far as it presupposes some other space as the condition of its limitation and so on
as regards limitation therefore our procedure in space is also a regressus and the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in a series of conditions applies to space also and i am entitled to demand the absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well as in time
whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to be answered in the sequel
secondly the real in spacethat is matteris conditioned
its internal conditions are its parts and the parts of parts its remote conditions so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis the absolute totality of which is a demand of reason
but this cannot be obtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts whereby the real in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter that is to say the simple
consequently we find here also a series of conditions and a progress to the unconditioned
thirdly as regards the categories of a real relation between phenomena the category of substance and its accidents is not suitable for the formation of a transcendental idea that is to say reason has no ground in regard to it to proceed regressively with conditions
for accidents in so far as they inhere in a substance are coordinated with each other and do not constitute a series
and in relation to substance they are not properly subordinated to it but are the mode of existence of the substance itself
the conception of the substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of the transcendental reason
but as this signifies nothing more than the conception of an object in general which subsists in so far as we cogitate in it merely a transcendental subject without any predicates and as the question here is of an unconditioned in the series of phenomenait is clear that the substantial can form no member thereof
the same holds good of substances in community which are mere aggregates and do not form a series
for they are not subordinated to each other as conditions of the possibility of each other which however may be affirmed of spaces the limits of which are never determined in themselves but always by some other space
it is therefore only in the category of causality that we can find a series of causes to a given effect and in which we ascend from the latter as the conditioned to the former as the conditions and thus answer the question of reason
fourthly the conceptions of the possible the actual and the necessary do not conduct us to any seriesexcepting only in so far as the contingent in existence must always be regarded as conditioned and as indicating according to a law of the understanding a condition under which it is necessary to rise to a higher till in the totality of the series reason arrives at unconditioned necessity
there are accordingly only four cosmological ideas corresponding with the four titles of the categories
for we can select only such as necessarily furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold
the absolute completeness of the composition of the given totality of all phenomena
the absolute completeness of the division of given totality in a phenomenon
the absolute completeness of the origination of a phenomenon
the absolute completeness of the dependence of the existence of what is changeable in a phenomenon
we must here remark in the first place that the idea of absolute totality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena and therefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things
phenomena are here therefore regarded as given and reason requires the absolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility in so far as these conditions constitute a seriesconsequently an absolutely that is in every respect complete synthesis whereby a phenomenon can be explained according to the laws of the understanding
secondly it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in this serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions
it wishes to speak in another way to attain to completeness in the series of premisses so as to render it unnecessary to presuppose others
this unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality of the series when we endeavour to form a representation of it in thought
but this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea for it is impossible at least before hand to know whether any such synthesis is possible in the case of phenomena
when we represent all existence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding without any conditions of sensuous intuition we may say with justice that for a given conditioned the whole series of conditions subordinated to each other is also given for the former is only given through the latter
but we find in the case of phenomena a particular limitation of the mode in which conditions are given that is through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition which must be complete in the regress
now whether this completeness is sensuously possible is a problem
but the idea of it lies in the reasonbe it possible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical conceptions
therefore as in the absolute totality of the regressive synthesis of the manifold in a phenomenon following the guidance of the categories which represent it as a series of conditions to a given conditioned the unconditioned is necessarily containedit being still left unascertained whether and how this totality exists reason sets out from the idea of totality although its proper and final aim is the unconditionedof the whole series or of a part thereof
this unconditioned may be cogitatedeither as existing only in the entire series all the members of which therefore would be without exception conditioned and only the totality absolutely unconditionedand in this case the regressus is called infinite or the absolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series to which the other members are subordinated but which is not itself submitted to any other condition
in the former case the series is a parte priori unlimited without beginning that is infinite and nevertheless completely given
but the regress in it is never completed and can only be called potentially infinite
in the second case there exists a first in the series
this first is called in relation to past time the beginning of the world in relation to space the limit of the world in relation to the parts of a given limited whole the simple in relation to causes absolute spontaneity liberty and in relation to the existence of changeable things absolute physical necessity
the absolute totality of the series of conditions to a given conditioned is always unconditioned because beyond it there exist no other conditions on which it might depend
but the absolute totality of such a series is only an idea or rather a problematical conception the possibility of which must be investigatedparticularly in relation to the mode in which the unconditioned as the transcendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry may be contained therein
we possess two expressions world and nature which are generally interchanged
the first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of their synthesisin its progress by means of composition as well as by division
and the world is termed nature when it is regarded as a dynamical wholewhen our attention is not directed to the aggregation in space and time for the purpose of cogitating it as a quantity but to the unity in the existence of phenomena
in this case the condition of that which happens is called a cause the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is termed liberty the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense a natural cause
the conditioned in existence is termed contingent and the unconditioned necessary
the unconditioned necessity of phenomena may be called natural necessity
nature understood adjective formaliter signifies the complex of the determinations of a thing connected according to an internal principle of causality
on the other hand we understand by nature substantive materialiter the sum total of phenomena in so far as they by virtue of an internal principle of causality are connected with each other throughout
in the former sense we speak of the nature of liquid matter of fire etc
and employ the word only adjective while if speaking of the objects of nature we have in our minds the idea of a subsisting whole
the ideas which we are at present engaged in discussing i have called cosmological ideas partly because by the term world is understood the entire content of all phenomena and our ideas are directed solely to the unconditioned among phenomena partly also because world in the transcendental sense signifies the absolute totality of the content of existing things and we are directing our attention only to the completeness of the synthesisalthough properly only in regression
in regard to the fact that these ideas are all transcendent and although they do not transcend phenomena as regards their mode but are concerned solely with the world of sense and not with noumena nevertheless carry their synthesis to a degree far above all possible experienceit still seems to me that we can with perfect propriety designate them cosmical conceptions
as regards the distinction between the mathematically and the dynamically unconditioned which is the aim of the regression of the synthesis i should call the two former in a more limited signification cosmical conceptions the remaining two transcendent physical conceptions
this distinction does not at present seem to be of particular importance but we shall afterwards find it to be of some value
section ii
antithetic of pure reason
thetic is the term applied to every collection of dogmatical propositions
by antithetic i do not understand dogmatical assertions of the opposite but the selfcontradiction of seemingly dogmatical cognitions thesis cum antithesis in none of which we can discover any decided superiority
antithetic is not therefore occupied with onesided statements but is engaged in considering the contradictory nature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes
transcendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure reason its causes and result
if we employ our reason not merely in the application of the principles of the understanding to objects of experience but venture with it beyond these boundaries there arise certain sophistical propositions or theorems
these assertions have the following peculiarities they can find neither confirmation nor confutation in experience and each is in itself not only selfconsistent but possesses conditions of its necessity in the very nature of reasononly that unluckily there exist just as valid and necessary grounds for maintaining the contrary proposition
the questions which naturally arise in the consideration of this dialectic of pure reason are therefore st
in what propositions is pure reason unavoidably subject to an antinomy nd
what are the causes of this antinomy rd
whether and in what way can reason free itself from this selfcontradiction
a dialectical proposition or theorem of pure reason must according to what has been said be distinguishable from all sophistical propositions by the fact that it is not an answer to an arbitrary question which may be raised at the mere pleasure of any person but to one which human reason must necessarily encounter in its progress
in the second place a dialectical proposition with its opposite does not carry the appearance of a merely artificial illusion which disappears as soon as it is investigated but a natural and unavoidable illusion which even when we are no longer deceived by it continues to mock us and although rendered harmless can never be completely removed
this dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understanding in empirical conceptions but to the unity of reason in pure ideas
the conditions of this doctrine areinasmuch as it must as a synthesis according to rules be conformable to the understanding and at the same time as the absolute unity of the synthesis to the reasonthat if it is adequate to the unity of reason it is too great for the understanding if according with the understanding it is too small for the reason
hence arises a mutual opposition which cannot be avoided do what we will
these sophistical assertions of dialectic open as it were a battlefield where that side obtains the victory which has been permitted to make the attack and he is compelled to yield who has been unfortunately obliged to stand on the defensive
and hence champions of ability whether on the right or on the wrong side are certain to carry away the crown of victory if they only take care to have the right to make the last attack and are not obliged to sustain another onset from their opponent
we can easily believe that this arena has been often trampled by the feet of combatants that many victories have been obtained on both sides but that the last victory decisive of the affair between the contending parties was won by him who fought for the right only if his adversary was forbidden to continue the tourney
as impartial umpires we must lay aside entirely the consideration whether the combatants are fighting for the right or for the wrong side for the true or for the false and allow the combat to be first decided
perhaps after they have wearied more than injured each other they will discover the nothingness of their cause of quarrel and part good friends
this method of watching or rather of originating a conflict of assertions not for the purpose of finally deciding in favour of either side but to discover whether the object of the struggle is not a mere illusion which each strives in vain to reach but which would be no gain even when reachedthis procedure i say may be termed the sceptical method
it is thoroughly distinct from scepticismthe principle of a technical and scientific ignorance which undermines the foundations of all knowledge in order if possible to destroy our belief and confidence therein
for the sceptical method aims at certainty by endeavouring to discover in a conflict of this kind conducted honestly and intelligently on both sides the point of misunderstanding just as wise legislators derive from the embarrassment of judges in lawsuits information in regard to the defective and illdefined parts of their statutes
the antinomy which reveals itself in the application of laws is for our limited wisdom the best criterion of legislation
for the attention of reason which in abstract speculation does not easily become conscious of its errors is thus roused to the momenta in the determination of its principles
but this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendental philosophy and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field of investigation
in mathematics its use would be absurd because in it no false assertions can long remain hidden inasmuch as its demonstrations must always proceed under the guidance of pure intuition and by means of an always evident synthesis
in experimental philosophy doubt and delay may be very useful but no misunderstanding is possible which cannot be easily removed and in experience means of solving the difficulty and putting an end to the dissension must at last be found whether sooner or later
moral philosophy can always exhibit its principles with their practical consequences in concretoat least in possible experiences and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities of abstraction
but transcendental propositions which lay claim to insight beyond the region of possible experience cannot on the one hand exhibit their abstract synthesis in any priori intuition nor on the other expose a lurking error by the help of experience
transcendental reason therefore presents us with no other criterion than that of an attempt to reconcile such assertions and for this purpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict between them
and this we now proceed to arrange
the antinomies stand in the order of the four transcendental ideas above detailed
first conflict of the transcendental ideas
thesis
the world has a beginning in time and is also limited in regard to space
proof
granted that the world has no beginning in time up to every given moment of time an eternity must have elapsed and therewith passed away an infinite series of successive conditions or states of things in the world
now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it never can be completed by means of a successive synthesis
it follows that an infinite series already elapsed is impossible and that consequently a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its existence
and this was the first thing to be proved
as regards the second let us take the opposite for granted
in this case the world must be an infinite given total of coexistent things
now we cannot cogitate the dimensions of a quantity which is not given within certain limits of an intuition in any other way than by means of the synthesis of its parts and the total of such a quantity only by means of a completed synthesis or the repeated addition of unity to itself
accordingly to cogitate the world which fills all spaces as a whole the successive synthesis of the parts of an infinite world must be looked upon as completed that is to say an infinite time must be regarded as having elapsed in the enumeration of all coexisting things which is impossible
for this reason an infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a given whole consequently not as a contemporaneously given whole
the world is consequently as regards extension in space not infinite but enclosed in limits
and this was the second thing to be proved
we may consider an undetermined quantity as a whole when it is enclosed within limits although we cannot construct or ascertain its totality by measurement that is by the successive synthesis of its parts
for its limits of themselves determine its completeness as a whole
antithesis
the world has no beginning and no limits in space but is in relation both to time and space infinite
proof
for let it be granted that it has a beginning
a beginning is an existence which is preceded by a time in which the thing does not exist
on the above supposition it follows that there must have been a time in which the world did not exist that is a void time
but in a void time the origination of a thing is impossible because no part of any such time contains a distinctive condition of being in preference to that of nonbeing whether the supposed thing originate of itself or by means of some other cause
consequently many series of things may have a beginning in the world but the world itself cannot have a beginning and is therefore in relation to past time infinite
as regards the second statement let us first take the opposite for grantedthat the world is finite and limited in space it follows that it must exist in a void space which is not limited
we should therefore meet not only with a relation of things in space but also a relation of things to space
now as the world is an absolute whole out of and beyond which no object of intuition and consequently no correlate to which can be discovered this relation of the world to a void space is merely a relation to no object
but such a relation and consequently the limitation of the world by void space is nothing
consequently the world as regards space is not limited that is it is infinite in regard to extension
space is merely the form of external intuition formal intuition and not a real object which can be externally perceived
space prior to all things which determine it fill or limit it or rather which present an empirical intuition conformable to it is under the title of absolute space nothing but the mere possibility of external phenomena in so far as they either exist in themselves or can annex themselves to given intuitions
empirical intuition is therefore not a composition of phenomena and space of perception and empty intuition
the one is not the correlate of the other in a synthesis but they are vitally connected in the same empirical intuition as matter and form
if we wish to set one of these two apart from the otherspace from phenomenathere arise all sorts of empty determinations of external intuition which are very far from being possible perceptions
for example motion or rest of the world in an infinite empty space or a determination of the mutual relation of both cannot possibly be perceived and is therefore merely the predicate of a notional entity
observations on the first antinomy
on the thesis
in bringing forward these conflicting arguments i have not been on the search for sophisms for the purpose of availing myself of special pleading which takes advantage of the carelessness of the opposite party appeals to a misunderstood statute and erects its unrighteous claims upon an unfair interpretation
both proofs originate fairly from the nature of the case and the advantage presented by the mistakes of the dogmatists of both parties has been completely set aside
the thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated by the introduction of an erroneous conception of the infinity of a given quantity
a quantity is infinite if a greater than itself cannot possibly exist
the quantity is measured by the number of given unitswhich are taken as a standardcontained in it
now no number can be the greatest because one or more units can always be added
it follows that an infinite given quantity consequently an infinite world both as regards time and extension is impossible
it is therefore limited in both respects
in this manner i might have conducted my proof but the conception given in it does not agree with the true conception of an infinite whole
in this there is no representation of its quantity it is not said how large it is consequently its conception is not the conception of a maximum
we cogitate in it merely its relation to an arbitrarily assumed unit in relation to which it is greater than any number
now just as the unit which is taken is greater or smaller the infinite will be greater or smaller but the infinity which consists merely in the relation to this given unit must remain always the same although the absolute quantity of the whole is not thereby cognized
the true transcendental conception of infinity is that the successive synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum can never be completed
hence it follows without possibility of mistake that an eternity of actual successive states up to a given the present moment cannot have elapsed and that the world must therefore have a beginning
the quantum in this sense contains a congeries of given units which is greater than any numberand this is the mathematical conception of the infinite
in regard to the second part of the thesis the difficulty as to an infinite and yet elapsed series disappears for the manifold of a world infinite in extension is contemporaneously given
but in order to cogitate the total of this manifold as we cannot have the aid of limits constituting by themselves this total in intuition we are obliged to give some account of our conception which in this case cannot proceed from the whole to the determined quantity of the parts but must demonstrate the possibility of a whole by means of a successive synthesis of the parts
but as this synthesis must constitute a series that cannot be completed it is impossible for us to cogitate prior to it and consequently not by means of it a totality
for the conception of totality itself is in the present case the representation of a completed synthesis of the parts and this completion and consequently its conception is impossible
on the antithesis
the proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and the cosmical content is based upon the consideration that in the opposite case a void time and a void space must constitute the limits of the world
now i am not unaware that there are some ways of escaping this conclusion
it may for example be alleged that a limit to the world as regards both space and time is quite possible without at the same time holding the existence of an absolute time before the beginning of the world or an absolute space extending beyond the actual worldwhich is impossible
i am quite well satisfied with the latter part of this opinion of the philosophers of the leibnitzian school
space is merely the form of external intuition but not a real object which can itself be externally intuited it is not a correlate of phenomena it is the form of phenomena itself
space therefore cannot be regarded as absolutely and in itself something determinative of the existence of things because it is not itself an object but only the form of possible objects
consequently things as phenomena determine space that is to say they render it possible that of all the possible predicates of space size and relation certain may belong to reality
but we cannot affirm the converse that space as something selfsubsistent can determine real things in regard to size or shape for it is in itself not a real thing
space filled or void may therefore be limited by phenomena but phenomena cannot be limited by an empty space without them
this is true of time also
all this being granted it is nevertheless indisputable that we must assume these two nonentities void space without and void time before the world if we assume the existence of cosmical limits relatively to space or time
it is evident that what is meant here is that empty space in so far as it is limited by phenomenaspace that is within the worlddoes not at least contradict transcendental principles and may therefore as regards them be admitted although its possibility cannot on that account be affirmed
for as regards the subterfuge adopted by those who endeavour to evade the consequencethat if the world is limited as to space and time the infinite void must determine the existence of actual things in regard to their dimensionsit arises solely from the fact that instead of a sensuous world an intelligible worldof which nothing is knownis cogitated instead of a real beginning an existence which is preceded by a period in which nothing exists an existence which presupposes no other condition than that of time and instead of limits of extension boundaries of the universe
but the question relates to the mundus phaenomenon and its quantity and in this case we cannot make abstraction of the conditions of sensibility without doing away with the essential reality of this world itself
the world of sense if it is limited must necessarily lie in the infinite void
if this and with it space as the priori condition of the possibility of phenomena is left out of view the whole world of sense disappears
in our problem is this alone considered as given
the mundus intelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world in which abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition and in relation to which no synthetical propositioneither affirmative or negativeis possible
second conflict of transcendental ideas
thesis
every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts and there exists nothing that is not either itself simple or composed of simple parts
proof
for grant that composite substances do not consist of simple parts in this case if all combination or composition were annihilated in thought no composite part and as by the supposition there do not exist simple parts no simple part would exist
consequently no substance consequently nothing would exist
either then it is impossible to annihilate composition in thought or after such annihilation there must remain something that subsists without composition that is something that is simple
but in the former case the composite could not itself consist of substances because with substances composition is merely a contingent relation apart from which they must still exist as selfsubsistent beings
now as this case contradicts the supposition the second must contain the truththat the substantial composite in the world consists of simple parts
it follows as an immediate inference that the things in the world are all without exception simple beingsthat composition is merely an external condition pertaining to themand that although we never can separate and isolate the elementary substances from the state of composition reason must cogitate these as the primary subjects of all composition and consequently as prior theretoand as simple substances
antithesis
no composite thing in the world consists of simple parts and there does not exist in the world any simple substance
proof
let it be supposed that a composite thing as substance consists of simple parts
inasmuch as all external relation consequently all composition of substances is possible only in space the space occupied by that which is composite must consist of the same number of parts as is contained in the composite
but space does not consist of simple parts but of spaces
therefore every part of the composite must occupy a space
but the absolutely primary parts of what is composite are simple
it follows that what is simple occupies a space
now as everything real that occupies a space contains a manifold the parts of which are external to each other and is consequently compositeand a real composite not of accidents for these cannot exist external to each other apart from substance but of substancesit follows that the simple must be a substantial composite which is selfcontradictory
the second proposition of the antithesisthat there exists in the world nothing that is simpleis here equivalent to the following the existence of the absolutely simple cannot be demonstrated from any experience or perception either external or internal and the absolutely simple is a mere idea the objective reality of which cannot be demonstrated in any possible experience it is consequently in the exposition of phenomena without application and object
for let us take for granted that an object may be found in experience for this transcendental idea the empirical intuition of such an object must then be recognized to contain absolutely no manifold with its parts external to each other and connected into unity
now as we cannot reason from the nonconsciousness of such a manifold to the impossibility of its existence in the intuition of an object and as the proof of this impossibility is necessary for the establishment and proof of absolute simplicity it follows that this simplicity cannot be inferred from any perception whatever
as therefore an absolutely simple object cannot be given in any experience and the world of sense must be considered as the sum total of all possible experiences nothing simple exists in the world
this second proposition in the antithesis has a more extended aim than the first
the first merely banishes the simple from the intuition of the composite while the second drives it entirely out of nature
hence we were unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given object of external intuition of the composite but we were obliged to prove it from the relation of a given object to a possible experience in general
observations on the second antinomy
thesis
when i speak of a whole which necessarily consists of simple parts i understand thereby only a substantial whole as the true composite that is to say i understand that contingent unity of the manifold which is given as perfectly isolated at least in thought placed in reciprocal connection and thus constituted a unity
space ought not to be called a compositum but a totum for its parts are possible in the whole and not the whole by means of the parts
it might perhaps be called a compositum ideale but not a compositum reale
but this is of no importance
as space is not a composite of substances and not even of real accidents if i abstract all composition thereinnothing not even a point remains for a point is possible only as the limit of a spaceconsequently of a composite
space and time therefore do not consist of simple parts
that which belongs only to the condition or state of a substance even although it possesses a quantity motion or change for example likewise does not consist of simple parts
that is to say a certain degree of change does not originate from the addition of many simple changes
our inference of the simple from the composite is valid only of selfsubsisting things
but the accidents of a state are not selfsubsistent
the proof then for the necessity of the simple as the component part of all that is substantial and composite may prove a failure and the whole case of this thesis be lost if we carry the proposition too far and wish to make it valid of everything that is composite without distinctionas indeed has really now and then happened
besides i am here speaking only of the simple in so far as it is necessarily given in the compositethe latter being capable of solution into the former as its component parts
the proper signification of the word monas as employed by leibnitz ought to relate to the simple given immediately as simple substance for example in consciousness and not as an element of the composite
as an clement the term atomus would be more appropriate
and as i wish to prove the existence of simple substances only in relation to and as the elements of the composite i might term the antithesis of the second antinomy transcendental atomistic
but as this word has long been employed to designate a particular theory of corporeal phenomena moleculae and thus presupposes a basis of empirical conceptions i prefer calling it the dialectical principle of monadology
antithesis
against the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whose ground of proof is purely mathematical objections have been alleged by the monadists
these objections lay themselves open at first sight to suspicion from the fact that they do not recognize the clearest mathematical proofs as propositions relating to the constitution of space in so far as it is really the formal condition of the possibility of all matter but regard them merely as inferences from abstract but arbitrary conceptions which cannot have any application to real things
just as if it were possible to imagine another mode of intuition than that given in the primitive intuition of space and just as if its priori determinations did not apply to everything the existence of which is possible from the fact alone of its filling space
if we listen to them we shall find ourselves required to cogitate in addition to the mathematical point which is simplenot however a part but a mere limit of spacephysical points which are indeed likewise simple but possess the peculiar property as parts of space of filling it merely by their aggregation
i shall not repeat here the common and clear refutations of this absurdity which are to be found everywhere in numbers every one knows that it is impossible to undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere discursive conceptions i shall only remark that if in this case philosophy endeavours to gain an advantage over mathematics by sophistical artifices it is because it forgets that the discussion relates solely to phenomena and their conditions
it is not sufficient to find the conception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite but we must discover for the intuition of the composite matter the intuition of the simple
now this according to the laws of sensibility and consequently in the case of objects of sense is utterly impossible
in the case of a whole composed of substances which is cogitated solely by the pure understanding it may be necessary to be in possession of the simple before composition is possible
but this does not hold good of the totum substantiale phaenomenon which as an empirical intuition in space possesses the necessary property of containing no simple part for the very reason that no part of space is simple
meanwhile the monadists have been subtle enough to escape from this difficulty by presupposing intuition and the dynamical relation of substances as the condition of the possibility of space instead of regarding space as the condition of the possibility of the objects of external intuition that is of bodies
now we have a conception of bodies only as phenomena and as such they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of all external phenomena
the evasion is therefore in vain as indeed we have sufficiently shown in our sthetic
if bodies were things in themselves the proof of the monadists would be unexceptionable
the second dialectical assertion possesses the peculiarity of having opposed to it a dogmatical proposition which among all such sophistical statements is the only one that undertakes to prove in the case of an object of experience that which is properly a transcendental ideathe absolute simplicity of substance
the proposition is that the object of the internal sense the thinking ego is an absolute simple substance
without at present entering upon this subjectas it has been considered at length in a former chapteri shall merely remark that if something is cogitated merely as an object without the addition of any synthetical determination of its intuitionas happens in the case of the bare representation iit is certain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a representation
as moreover the predicates whereby i cogitate this object are merely intuitions of the internal sense there cannot be discovered in them anything to prove the existence of a manifold whose parts are external to each other and consequently nothing to prove the existence of real composition
consciousness therefore is so constituted that inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same time its own object it cannot divide itselfalthough it can divide its inhering determinations
for every object in relation to itself is absolute unity
nevertheless if the subject is regarded externally as an object of intuition it must in its character of phenomenon possess the property of composition
and it must always be regarded in this manner if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in it a manifold whose parts are external to each other
third conflict of the transcendental ideas
thesis
causality according to the laws of nature is not the only causality operating to originate the phenomena of the world
a causality of freedom is also necessary to account fully for these phenomena
proof
let it be supposed that there is no other kind of causality than that according to the laws of nature
consequently everything that happens presupposes a previous condition which it follows with absolute certainty in conformity with a rule
but this previous condition must itself be something that has happened that has arisen in time as it did not exist before for if it has always been in existence its consequence or effect would not thus originate for the first time but would likewise have always existed
the causality therefore of a cause whereby something happens is itself a thing that has happened
now this again presupposes in conformity with the law of nature a previous condition and its causality and this another anterior to the former and so on
if then everything happens solely in accordance with the laws of nature there cannot be any real first beginning of things but only a subaltern or comparative beginning
there cannot therefore be a completeness of series on the side of the causes which originate the one from the other
but the law of nature is that nothing can happen without a sufficient priori determined cause
the proposition thereforeif all causality is possible only in accordance with the laws of natureis when stated in this unlimited and general manner selfcontradictory
it follows that this cannot be the only kind of causality
from what has been said it follows that a causality must be admitted by means of which something happens without its cause being determined according to necessary laws by some other cause preceding
that is to say there must exist an absolute spontaneity of cause which of itself originates a series of phenomena which proceeds according to natural lawsconsequently transcendental freedom without which even in the course of nature the succession of phenomena on the side of causes is never complete
antithesis
there is no such thing as freedom but everything in the world happens solely according to the laws of nature
proof
granted that there does exist freedom in the transcendental sense as a peculiar kind of causality operating to produce events in the worlda faculty that is to say of originating a state and consequently a series of consequences from that state
in this case not only the series originated by this spontaneity but the determination of this spontaneity itself to the production of the series that is to say the causality itself must have an absolute commencement such that nothing can precede to determine this action according to unvarying laws
but every beginning of action presupposes in the acting cause a state of inaction and a dynamically primal beginning of action presupposes a state which has no connectionas regards causalitywith the preceding state of the causewhich does not that is in any wise result from it
transcendental freedom is therefore opposed to the natural law of cause and effect and such a conjunction of successive states in effective causes is destructive of the possibility of unity in experience and for that reason not to be found in experienceis consequently a mere fiction of thought
we have therefore nothing but nature to which we must look for connection and order in cosmical events
freedomindependence of the laws of natureis certainly a deliverance from restraint but it is also a relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule
for it cannot be alleged that instead of the laws of nature laws of freedom may be introduced into the causality of the course of nature
for if freedom were determined according to laws it would be no longer freedom but merely nature
nature therefore and transcendental freedom are distinguishable as conformity to law and lawlessness
the former imposes upon understanding the difficulty of seeking the origin of events ever higher and higher in the series of causes inasmuch as causality is always conditioned thereby while it compensates this labour by the guarantee of a unity complete and in conformity with law
the latter on the contrary holds out to the understanding the promise of a point of rest in the chain of causes by conducting it to an unconditioned causality which professes to have the power of spontaneous origination but which in its own utter blindness deprives it of the guidance of rules by which alone a completely connected experience is possible
observations on the third antinomy
on the thesis
the transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entire content of the psychological conception so termed which is for the most part empirical
it merely presents us with the conception of spontaneity of action as the proper ground for imputing freedom to the cause of a certain class of objects
it is however the true stumblingstone to philosophy which meets with unconquerable difficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of unconditioned causality
that element in the question of the freedom of the will which has for so long a time placed speculative reason in such perplexity is properly only transcendental and concerns the question whether there must be held to exist a faculty of spontaneous origination of a series of successive things or states
how such a faculty is possible is not a necessary inquiry for in the case of natural causality itself we are obliged to content ourselves with the priori knowledge that such a causality must be presupposed although we are quite incapable of comprehending how the being of one thing is possible through the being of another but must for this information look entirely to experience
now we have demonstrated this necessity of a free first beginning of a series of phenomena only in so far as it is required for the comprehension of an origin of the world all following states being regarded as a succession according to laws of nature alone
but as there has thus been proved the existence of a faculty which can of itself originate a series in timealthough we are unable to explain how it can existwe feel ourselves authorized to admit even in the midst of the natural course of events a beginning as regards causality of different successions of phenomena and at the same time to attribute to all substances a faculty of free action
but we ought in this case not to allow ourselves to fall into a common misunderstanding and to suppose that because a successive series in the world can only have a comparatively first beginninganother state or condition of things always precedingan absolutely first beginning of a series in the course of nature is impossible
for we are not speaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time but as regards causality alone
when for example i completely of my own free will and independently of the necessarily determinative influence of natural causes rise from my chair there commences with this event including its material consequences in infinitum an absolutely new series although in relation to time this event is merely the continuation of a preceding series
for this resolution and act of mine do not form part of the succession of effects in nature and are not mere continuations of it on the contrary the determining causes of nature cease to operate in reference to this event which certainly succeeds the acts of nature but does not proceed from them
for these reasons the action of a free agent must be termed in regard to causality if not in relation to time an absolutely primal beginning of a series of phenomena
the justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as the first beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from the fact that all philosophers of antiquity with the exception of the epicurean school felt themselves obliged when constructing a theory of the motions of the universe to accept a prime mover that is a freely acting cause which spontaneously and prior to all other causes evolved this series of states
they always felt the need of going beyond mere nature for the purpose of making a first beginning comprehensible
on the antithesis
the assertor of the allsufficiency of nature in regard to causality transcendental physiocracy in opposition to the doctrine of freedom would defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner
he would say in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite party if you do not accept a mathematical first in relation to time you have no need to seek a dynamical first in regard to causality
who compelled you to imagine an absolutely primal condition of the world and therewith an absolute beginning of the gradually progressing successions of phenomenaand as some foundation for this fancy of yours to set bounds to unlimited nature inasmuch as the substances in the world have always existedat least the unity of experience renders such a supposition quite necessarythere is no difficulty in believing also that the changes in the conditions of these substances have always existed and consequently that a first beginning mathematical or dynamical is by no means required
the possibility of such an infinite derivation without any initial member from which all the others result is certainly quite incomprehensible
but if you are rash enough to deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason you will find yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of many fundamental properties of natural objects such as fundamental forces which you can just as little comprehend and even the possibility of so simple a conception as that of change must present to you insuperable difficulties
for if experience did not teach you that it was real you never could conceive priori the possibility of this ceaseless sequence of being and nonbeing
but if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom is granteda faculty of originating changes in the worldthis faculty must at least exist out of and apart from the world although it is certainly a bold assumption that over and above the complete content of all possible intuitions there still exists an object which cannot be presented in any possible perception
but to attribute to substances in the world itself such a faculty is quite inadmissible for in this case the connection of phenomena reciprocally determining and determined according to general laws which is termed nature and along with it the criteria of empirical truth which enable us to distinguish experience from mere visionary dreaming would almost entirely disappear
in proximity with such a lawless faculty of freedom a system of nature is hardly cogitable for the laws of the latter would be continually subject to the intrusive influences of the former and the course of phenomena which would otherwise proceed regularly and uniformly would become thereby confused and disconnected
fourth conflict of the transcendental ideas
thesis
there exists either in or in connection with the worldeither as a part of it or as the cause of itan absolutely necessary being
proof
the world of sense as the sum total of all phenomena contains a series of changes
for without such a series the mental representation of the series of time itself as the condition of the possibility of the sensuous world could not be presented to us
but every change stands under its condition which precedes it in time and renders it necessary
now the existence of a given condition presupposes a complete series of conditions up to the absolutely unconditioned which alone is absolutely necessary
it follows that something that is absolutely necessary must exist if change exists as its consequence
but this necessary thing itself belongs to the sensuous world
for suppose it to exist out of and apart from it the series of cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning and yet this necessary cause would not itself belong to the world of sense
but this is impossible
for as the beginning of a series in time is determined only by that which precedes it in time the supreme condition of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the time in which this series itself did not exist for a beginning supposes a time preceding in which the thing that begins to be was not in existence
the causality of the necessary cause of changes and consequently the cause itself must for these reasons belong to timeand to phenomena time being possible only as the form of phenomena
consequently it cannot be cogitated as separated from the world of sensethe sum total of all phenomena
there is therefore contained in the world something that is absolutely necessarywhether it be the whole cosmical series itself or only a part of it
objectively time as the formal condition of the possibility of change precedes all changes but subjectively and in consciousness the representation of time like every other is given solely by occasion of perception
antithesis
an absolutely necessary being does not exist either in the world or out of itas its cause
proof
grant that either the world itself is necessary or that there is contained in it a necessary existence
two cases are possible
first there must either be in the series of cosmical changes a beginning which is unconditionally necessary and therefore uncausedwhich is at variance with the dynamical law of the determination of all phenomena in time or secondly the series itself is without beginning and although contingent and conditioned in all its parts is nevertheless absolutely necessary and unconditioned as a wholewhich is selfcontradictory
for the existence of an aggregate cannot be necessary if no single part of it possesses necessary existence
grant on the other hand that an absolutely necessary cause exists out of and apart from the world
this cause as the highest member in the series of the causes of cosmical changes must originate or begin the existence of the latter and their series
in this case it must also begin to act and its causality would therefore belong to time and consequently to the sum total of phenomena that is to the world
it follows that the cause cannot be out of the world which is contradictory to the hypothesis
therefore neither in the world nor out of it but in causal connection with it does there exist any absolutely necessary being
the word begin is taken in two senses
the first is activethe cause being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect infit
the second is passivethe causality in the cause itself beginning to operate fit
i reason here from the first to the second
observations on the fourth antinomy
on the thesis
to demonstrate the existence of a necessary being i cannot be permitted in this place to employ any other than the cosmological argument which ascends from the conditioned in phenomena to the unconditioned in conceptionthe unconditioned being considered the necessary condition of the absolute totality of the series
the proof from the mere idea of a supreme being belongs to another principle of reason and requires separate discussion
the pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessary being but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled whether this being is the world itself or quite distinct from it
to establish the truth of the latter view principles are requisite which are not cosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena
we should require to introduce into our proof conceptions of contingent beingsregarded merely as objects of the understanding and also a principle which enables us to connect these by means of mere conceptions with a necessary being
but the proper place for all such arguments is a transcendent philosophy which has unhappily not yet been established
but if we begin our proof cosmologically by laying at the foundation of it the series of phenomena and the regress in it according to empirical laws of causality we are not at liberty to break off from this mode of demonstration and to pass over to something which is not itself a member of the series
the condition must be taken in exactly the same signification as the relation of the conditioned to its condition in the series has been taken for the series must conduct us in an unbroken regress to this supreme condition
but if this relation is sensuous and belongs to the possible empirical employment of understanding the supreme condition or cause must close the regressive series according to the laws of sensibility and consequently must belong to the series of time
it follows that this necessary existence must be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series
certain philosophers have nevertheless allowed themselves the liberty of making such a saltus metabasis eis allo gonos
from the changes in the world they have concluded their empirical contingency that is their dependence on empiricallydetermined causes and they thus admitted an ascending series of empirical conditions and in this they are quite right
but as they could not find in this series any primal beginning or any highest member they passed suddenly from the empirical conception of contingency to the pure category which presents us with a seriesnot sensuous but intellectualwhose completeness does certainly rest upon the existence of an absolutely necessary cause
nay more this intellectual series is not tied to any sensuous conditions and is therefore free from the condition of time which requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time
but such a procedure is perfectly inadmissible as will be made plain from what follows
in the pure sense of the categories that is contingent the contradictory opposite of which is possible
now we cannot reason from empirical contingency to intellectual
the opposite of that which is changedthe opposite of its stateis actual at another time and is therefore possible
consequently it is not the contradictory opposite of the former state
to be that it is necessary that in the same time in which the preceding state existed its opposite could have existed in its place but such a cognition is not given us in the mere phenomenon of change
a body that was in motion a comes into a state of rest nona
now it cannot be concluded from the fact that a state opposite to the state a follows it that the contradictory opposite of a is possible and that a is therefore contingent
to prove this we should require to know that the state of rest could have existed in the very same time in which the motion took place
now we know nothing more than that the state of rest was actual in the time that followed the state of motion consequently that it was also possible
but motion at one time and rest at another time are not contradictorily opposed to each other
it follows from what has been said that the succession of opposite determinations that is change does not demonstrate the fact of contingency as represented in the conceptions of the pure understanding and that it cannot therefore conduct us to the fact of the existence of a necessary being
change proves merely empirical contingency that is to say that the new state could not have existed without a cause which belongs to the preceding time
this causeeven although it is regarded as absolutely necessarymust be presented to us in time and must belong to the series of phenomena
on the antithesis
the difficulties which meet us in our attempt to rise through the series of phenomena to the existence of an absolutely necessary supreme cause must not originate from our inability to establish the truth of our mere conceptions of the necessary existence of a thing
that is to say our objections not be ontological but must be directed against the causal connection with a series of phenomena of a condition which is itself unconditioned
in one word they must be cosmological and relate to empirical laws
we must show that the regress in the series of causes in the world of sense cannot conclude with an empirically unconditioned condition and that the cosmological argument from the contingency of the cosmical statea contingency alleged to arise from changedoes not justify us in accepting a first cause that is a prime originator of the cosmical series
the reader will observe in this antinomy a very remarkable contrast
the very same grounds of proof which established in the thesis the existence of a supreme being demonstrated in the antithesisand with equal strictnessthe nonexistence of such a being
we found first that a necessary being exists because the whole time past contains the series of all conditions and with it therefore the unconditioned the necessary secondly that there does not exist any necessary being for the same reason that the whole time past contains the series of all conditionswhich are themselves therefore in the aggregate conditioned
the cause of this seeming incongruity is as follows
we attend in the first argument solely to the absolute totality of the series of conditions the one of which determines the other in time and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned
in the second we consider on the contrary the contingency of everything that is determined in the series of timefor every event is preceded by a time in which the condition itself must be determined as conditionedand thus everything that is unconditioned or absolutely necessary disappears
in both the mode of proof is quite in accordance with the common procedure of human reason which often falls into discord with itself from considering an object from two different points of view
herr von mairan regarded the controversy between two celebrated astronomers which arose from a similar difficulty as to the choice of a proper standpoint as a phenomenon of sufficient importance to warrant a separate treatise on the subject
the one concluded the moon revolves on its own axis because it constantly presents the same side to the earth the other declared that the moon does not revolve on its own axis for the same reason
both conclusions were perfectly correct according to the point of view from which the motions of the moon were considered
section iii
of the interest of reason in these selfcontradictions
we have thus completely before us the dialectical procedure of the cosmological ideas
no possible experience can present us with an object adequate to them in extent
nay more reason itself cannot cogitate them as according with the general laws of experience
and yet they are not arbitrary fictions of thought
on the contrary reason in its uninterrupted progress in the empirical synthesis is necessarily conducted to them when it endeavours to free from all conditions and to comprehend in its unconditioned totality that which can only be determined conditionally in accordance with the laws of experience
these dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve four natural and unavoidable problems of reason
there are neither more nor can there be less than this number because there are no other series of synthetical hypotheses limiting priori the empirical synthesis
the brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyond the limits of experience have been represented above only in dry formulae which contain merely the grounds of its pretensions
they have besides in conformity with the character of a transcendental philosophy been freed from every empirical element although the full splendour of the promises they hold out and the anticipations they excite manifests itself only when in connection with empirical cognitions
in the application of them however and in the advancing enlargement of the employment of reason while struggling to rise from the region of experience and to soar to those sublime ideas philosophy discovers a value and a dignity which if it could but make good its assertions would raise it far above all other departments of human knowledgeprofessing as it does to present a sure foundation for our highest hopes and the ultimate aims of all the exertions of reason
the questions whether the world has a beginning and a limit to its extension in space whether there exists anywhere or perhaps in my own thinking self an indivisible and indestructible unityor whether nothing but what is divisible and transitory exists whether i am a free agent or like other beings am bound in the chains of nature and fate whether finally there is a supreme cause of the world or all our thought and speculation must end with nature and the order of external thingsare questions for the solution of which the mathematician would willingly exchange his whole science for in it there is no satisfaction for the highest aspirations and most ardent desires of humanity
nay it may even be said that the true value of mathematicsthat pride of human reasonconsists in this that she guides reason to the knowledge of naturein her greater as well as in her less manifestationsin her beautiful order and regularityguides her moreover to an insight into the wonderful unity of the moving forces in the operations of nature far beyond the expectations of a philosophy building only on experience and that she thus encourages philosophy to extend the province of reason beyond all experience and at the same time provides it with the most excellent materials for supporting its investigations in so far as their nature admits by adequate and accordant intuitions
unfortunately for speculationbut perhaps fortunately for the practical interests of humanityreason in the midst of her highest anticipations finds herself hemmed in by a press of opposite and contradictory conclusions from which neither her honour nor her safety will permit her to draw back
nor can she regard these conflicting trains of reasoning with indifference as mere passages at arms still less can she command peace for in the subject of the conflict she has a deep interest
there is no other course left open to her than to reflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in reasonwhether it may not arise from a mere misunderstanding
after such an inquiry arrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides but the sovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upon a sure foundation
we shall at present defer this radical inquiry and in the meantime consider for a little what side in the controversy we should most willingly take if we were obliged to become partisans at all
as in this case we leave out of sight altogether the logical criterion of truth and merely consult our own interest in reference to the question these considerations although inadequate to settle the question of right in either party will enable us to comprehend how those who have taken part in the struggle adopt the one view rather than the otherno special insight into the subject however having influenced their choice
they will at the same time explain to us many other things by the wayfor example the fiery zeal on the one side and the cold maintenance of their cause on the other why the one party has met with the warmest approbations and the other has always been repulsed by irreconcilable prejudices
there is one thing however that determines the proper point of view from which alone this preliminary inquiry can be instituted and carried on with the proper completenessand that is the comparison of the principles from which both sides thesis and antithesis proceed
my readers would remark in the propositions of the antithesis a complete uniformity in the mode of thought and a perfect unity of principle
its principle was that of pure empiricism not only in the explication of the phenomena in the world but also in the solution of the transcendental ideas even of that of the universe itself
the affirmations of the thesis on the contrary were based in addition to the empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena on intellectual propositions and its principles were in so far not simple
i shall term the thesis in view of its essential characteristic the dogmatism of pure reason
on the side of dogmatism or of the thesis therefore in the determination of the cosmological ideas we find
a practical interest which must be very dear to every rightthinking man
that the word has a beginningthat the nature of my thinking self is simple and therefore indestructiblethat i am a free agent and raised above the compulsion of nature and her lawsand finally that the entire order of things which form the world is dependent upon a supreme being from whom the whole receives unity and connectionthese are so many foundationstones of morality and religion
the antithesis deprives us of all these supportsor at least seems so to deprive us
a speculative interest of reason manifests itself on this side
for if we take the transcendental ideas and employ them in the manner which the thesis directs we can exhibit completely priori the entire chain of conditions and understand the derivation of the conditionedbeginning from the unconditioned
this the antithesis does not do and for this reason does not meet with so welcome a reception
for it can give no answer to our question respecting the conditions of its synthesisexcept such as must be supplemented by another question and so on to infinity
according to it we must rise from a given beginning to one still higher every part conducts us to a still smaller one every event is preceded by another event which is its cause and the conditions of existence rest always upon other and still higher conditions and find neither end nor basis in some selfsubsistent thing as the primal being
this side has also the advantage of popularity and this constitutes no small part of its claim to favour
the common understanding does not find the least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of all synthesisaccustomed as it is rather to follow our consequences than to seek for a proper basis for cognition
in the conception of an absolute first moreoverthe possibility of which it does not inquire intoit is highly gratified to find a firmlyestablished point of departure for its attempts at theory while in the restless and continuous ascent from the conditioned to the condition always with one foot in the air it can find no satisfaction
on the side of the antithesis or empiricism in the determination of the cosmological ideas
we cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pure principles of reason as morality and religion present
on the contrary pure empiricism seems to empty them of all their power and influence
if there does not exist a supreme being distinct from the worldif the world is without beginning consequently without a creatorif our wills are not free and the soul is divisible and subject to corruption just like matterthe ideas and principles of morality lose all validity and fall with the transcendental ideas which constituted their theoretical support
but empiricism in compensation holds out to reason in its speculative interests certain important advantages far exceeding any that the dogmatist can promise us
for when employed by the empiricist understanding is always upon its proper ground of investigationthe field of possible experience the laws of which it can explore and thus extend its cognition securely and with clear intelligence without being stopped by limits in any direction
here can it and ought it to find and present to intuition its proper objectnot only in itself but in all its relations or if it employ conceptions upon this ground it can always present the corresponding images in clear and unmistakable intuitions
it is quite unnecessary for it to renounce the guidance of nature to attach itself to ideas the objects of which it cannot know because as mere intellectual entities they cannot be presented in any intuition
on the contrary it is not even permitted to abandon its proper occupation under the pretence that it has been brought to a conclusion for it never can be and to pass into the region of idealizing reason and transcendent conceptions which it is not required to observe and explore the laws of nature but merely to think and to imaginesecure from being contradicted by facts because they have not been called as witnesses but passed by or perhaps subordinated to the socalled higher interests and considerations of pure reason
hence the empiricist will never allow himself to accept any epoch of nature for the firstthe absolutely primal state he will not believe that there can be limits to his outlook into her wide domains nor pass from the objects of nature which he can satisfactorily explain by means of observation and mathematical thoughtwhich he can determine synthetically in intuition to those which neither sense nor imagination can ever present in concreto he will not concede the existence of a faculty in nature operating independently of the laws of naturea concession which would introduce uncertainty into the procedure of the understanding which is guided by necessary laws to the observation of phenomena nor finally will he permit himself to seek a cause beyond nature inasmuch as we know nothing but it and from it alone receive an objective basis for all our conceptions and instruction in the unvarying laws of things
in truth if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose in the establishment of his antithesis than to check the presumption of a reason which mistakes its true destination which boasts of its insight and its knowledge just where all insight and knowledge cease to exist and regards that which is valid only in relation to a practical interest as an advancement of the speculative interests of the mind in order when it is convenient for itself to break the thread of our physical investigations and under pretence of extending our cognition connect them with transcendental ideas by means of which we really know only that we know nothingif i say the empiricist rested satisfied with this benefit the principle advanced by him would be a maxim recommending moderation in the pretensions of reason and modesty in its affirmations and at the same time would direct us to the right mode of extending the province of the understanding by the help of the only true teacher experience
in obedience to this advice intellectual hypotheses and faith would not be called in aid of our practical interests nor should we introduce them under the pompous titles of science and insight
for speculative cognition cannot find an objective basis any other where than in experience and when we overstep its limits our synthesis which requires ever new cognitions independent of experience has no substratum of intuition upon which to build
but ifas often happensempiricism in relation to ideas becomes itself dogmatic and boldly denies that which is above the sphere of its phenomenal cognition it falls itself into the error of intemperancean error which is here all the more reprehensible as thereby the practical interest of reason receives an irreparable injury
and this constitutes the opposition between epicureanism and platonism
it is however still a matter of doubt whether epicurus ever propounded these principles as directions for the objective employment of the understanding
if indeed they were nothing more than maxims for the speculative exercise of reason he gives evidence therein a more genuine philosophic spirit than any of the philosophers of antiquity
that in the explanation of phenomena we must proceed as if the field of inquiry had neither limits in space nor commencement in time that we must be satisfied with the teaching of experience in reference to the material of which the world is posed that we must not look for any other mode of the origination of events than that which is determined by the unalterable laws of nature and finally that we not employ the hypothesis of a cause distinct from the world to account for a phenomenon or for the world itselfare principles for the extension of speculative philosophy and the discovery of the true sources of the principles of morals which however little conformed to in the present day are undoubtedly correct
at the same time any one desirous of ignoring in mere speculation these dogmatical propositions need not for that reason be accused of denying them
both epicurus and plato assert more in their systems than they know
the former encourages and advances sciencealthough to the prejudice of the practical the latter presents us with excellent principles for the investigation of the practical but in relation to everything regarding which we can attain to speculative cognition permits reason to append idealistic explanations of natural phenomena to the great injury of physical investigation
in regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a party in this war of assertions it seems very extraordinary that empiricism should be utterly unpopular
we should be inclined to believe that the common understanding would receive it with pleasurepromising as it does to satisfy it without passing the bounds of experience and its connected order while transcendental dogmatism obliges it to rise to conceptions which far surpass the intelligence and ability of the most practised thinkers
but in this in truth is to be found its real motive
for the common understanding thus finds itself in a situation where not even the most learned can have the advantage of it
if it understands little or nothing about these transcendental conceptions no one can boast of understanding any more and although it may not express itself in so scholastically correct a manner as others it can busy itself with reasoning and arguments without end wandering among mere ideas about which one can always be very eloquent because we know nothing about them while in the observation and investigation of nature it would be forced to remain dumb and to confess its utter ignorance
thus indolence and vanity form of themselves strong recommendations of these principles
besides although it is a hard thing for a philosopher to assume a principle of which he can give to himself no reasonable account and still more to employ conceptions the objective reality of which cannot be established nothing is more usual with the common understanding
it wants something which will allow it to go to work with confidence
the difficulty of even comprehending a supposition does not disquiet it becausenot knowing what comprehending meansit never even thinks of the supposition it may be adopting as a principle and regards as known that with which it has become familiar from constant use
and at last all speculative interests disappear before the practical interests which it holds dear and it fancies that it understands and knows what its necessities and hopes incite it to assume or to believe
thus the empiricism of transcendentally idealizing reason is robbed of all popularity and however prejudicial it may be to the highest practical principles there is no fear that it will ever pass the limits of the schools or acquire any favour or influence in society or with the multitude
human reason is by nature architectonic
that is to say it regards all cognitions as parts of a possible system and hence accepts only such principles as at least do not incapacitate a cognition to which we may have attained from being placed along with others in a general system
but the propositions of the antithesis are of a character which renders the completion of an edifice of cognitions impossible
according to these beyond one state or epoch of the world there is always to be found one more ancient in every part always other parts themselves divisible preceding every event another the origin of which must itself be sought still higher and everything in existence is conditioned and still not dependent on an unconditioned and primal existence
as therefore the antithesis will not concede the existence of a first beginning which might be available as a foundation a complete edifice of cognition in the presence of such hypothesis is utterly impossible
thus the architectonic interest of reason which requires a unitynot empirical but priori and rationalforms a natural recommendation for the assertions of the thesis in our antinomy
but if any one could free himself entirely from all considerations of interest and weigh without partiality the assertions of reason attending only to their content irrespective of the consequences which follow from them such a person on the supposition that he knew no other way out of the confusion than to settle the truth of one or other of the conflicting doctrines would live in a state of continual hesitation
today he would feel convinced that the human will is free tomorrow considering the indissoluble chain of nature he would look on freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be allinall
but if he were called to action the play of the merely speculative reason would disappear like the shapes of a dream and practical interest would dictate his choice of principles
but as it well befits a reflective and inquiring being to devote certain periods of time to the examination of its own reasonto divest itself of all partiality and frankly to communicate its observations for the judgement and opinion of others so no one can be blamed for much less prevented from placing both parties on their trial with permission to end themselves free from intimidation before intimidation before a sworn jury of equal condition with themselvesthe condition of weak and fallible men
section iv
of the necessity imposed upon pure reason of presenting a solution of its transcendental problems
to avow an ability to solve all problems and to answer all questions would be a profession certain to convict any philosopher of extravagant boasting and selfconceit and at once to destroy the confidence that might otherwise have been reposed in him
there are however sciences so constituted that every question arising within their sphere must necessarily be capable of receiving an answer from the knowledge already possessed for the answer must be received from the same sources whence the question arose
in such sciences it is not allowable to excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable ignorance a solution is absolutely requisite
the rule of right and wrong must help us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possible cases otherwise the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null for we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know
on the other hand in our investigations of the phenomena of nature much must remain uncertain and many questions continue insoluble because what we know of nature is far from being sufficient to explain all the phenomena that are presented to our observation
now the question is whether there is in transcendental philosophy any question relating to an object presented to pure reason which is unanswerable by this reason and whether we must regard the subject of the question as quite uncertain so far as our knowledge extends and must give it a place among those subjects of which we have just so much conception as is sufficient to enable us to raise a questionfaculty or materials failing us however when we attempt an answer
now i maintain that among all speculative cognition the peculiarity of transcendental philosophy is that there is no question relating to an object presented to pure reason which is insoluble by this reason and that the profession of unavoidable ignorancethe problem being alleged to be beyond the reach of our facultiescannot free us from the obligation to present a complete and satisfactory answer
for the very conception which enables us to raise the question must give us the power of answering it inasmuch as the object as in the case of right and wrong is not to be discovered out of the conception
but in transcendental philosophy it is only the cosmological questions to which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation to the constitution of their object and the philosopher is not permitted to avail himself of the pretext of necessary ignorance and impenetrable obscurity
these questions relate solely to the cosmological ideas
for the object must be given in experience and the question relates to the adequateness of the object to an idea
if the object is transcendental and therefore itself unknown if the question for example is whether the objectthe something the phenomenon of which internalin ourselves is thoughtthat is to say the soul is in itself a simple being or whether there is a cause of all things which is absolutely necessaryin such cases we are seeking for our idea an object of which we may confess that it is unknown to us though we must not on that account assert that it is impossible
the cosmological ideas alone posses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them and the empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to be given and the question which arises from these ideas relates merely to the progress of this synthesis in so far as it must contain absolute totalitywhich however is not empirical as it cannot be given in any experience
now as the question here is solely in regard to a thing as the object of a possible experience and not as a thing in itself the answer to the transcendental cosmological question need not be sought out of the idea for the question does not regard an object in itself
the question in relation to a possible experience is not what can be given in an experience in concreto but what is contained in the idea to which the empirical synthesis must approximate
the question must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone
for the idea is a creation of reason itself which therefore cannot disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object
the question what is the constitution of a transcendental object is unanswerablewe are unable to say what it is but we can perceive that the question itself is nothing because it does not relate to any object that can be presented to us
for this reason we must consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as answerable and as really answered for they relate to the transcendental subject of all internal phenomena which is not itself phenomenon and consequently not given as an object in which moreover none of the categoriesand it is to them that the question is properly directedfind any conditions of its application
here therefore is a case where no answer is the only proper answer
for a question regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be cogitated by any determined predicate being completely beyond the sphere of objects and experience is perfectly null and void
it is not so extraordinary as it at first sight appears that a science should demand and expect satisfactory answers to all the questions that may arise within its own sphere questiones domesticae although up to a certain time these answers may not have been discovered
there are in addition to transcendental philosophy only two pure sciences of reason the one with a speculative the other with a practical contentpure mathematics and pure ethics
has any one ever heard it alleged that from our complete and necessary ignorance of the conditions it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers by the former the sum cannot be given exactly by the latter only approximately and therefore we decide that the impossibility of a solution of the question is evident
lambert presented us with a demonstration of this
in the general principles of morals there can be nothing uncertain for the propositions are either utterly without meaning or must originate solely in our rational conceptions
on the other hand there must be in physical science an infinite number of conjectures which can never become certainties because the phenomena of nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions
the key to the solution of such questions cannot therefore be found in our conceptions or in pure thought but must lie without us and for that reason is in many cases not to be discovered and consequently a satisfactory explanation cannot be expected
the questions of transcendental analytic which relate to the deduction of our pure cognition are not to be regarded as of the same kind as those mentioned above for we are not at present treating of the certainty of judgements in relation to the origin of our conceptions but only of that certainty in relation to objects
we cannot therefore escape the responsibility of at least a critical solution of the questions of reason by complaints of the limited nature of our faculties and the seemingly humble confession that it is beyond the power of our reason to decide whether the world has existed from all eternity or had a beginningwhether it is infinitely extended or enclosed within certain limitswhether anything in the world is simple or whether everything must be capable of infinite divisibilitywhether freedom can originate phenomena or whether everything is absolutely dependent on the laws and order of natureand finally whether there exists a being that is completely unconditioned and necessary or whether the existence of everything is conditioned and consequently dependent on something external to itself and therefore in its own nature contingent
for all these questions relate to an object which can be given nowhere else than in thought
this object is the absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis of phenomena
if the conceptions in our minds do not assist us to some certain result in regard to these problems we must not defend ourselves on the plea that the object itself remains hidden from and unknown to us
for no such thing or object can be givenit is not to be found out of the idea in our minds
we must seek the cause of our failure in our idea itself which is an insoluble problem and in regard to which we obstinately assume that there exists a real object corresponding and adequate to it
a clear explanation of the dialectic which lies in our conception will very soon enable us to come to a satisfactory decision in regard to such a question
the pretext that we are unable to arrive at certainty in regard to these problems may be met with this question which requires at least a plain answer from what source do the ideas originate the solution of which involves you in such difficulties are you seeking for an explanation of certain phenomena and do you expect these ideas to give you the principles or the rules of this explanation let it be granted that all nature was laid open before you that nothing was hid from your senses and your consciousness
still you could not cognize in concreto the object of your ideas in any experience
for what is demanded is not only this full and complete intuition but also a complete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality and this is not possible by means of any empirical cognition
it follows that your questionyour ideais by no means necessary for the explanation of any phenomenon and the idea cannot have been in any sense given by the object itself
for such an object can never be presented to us because it cannot be given by any possible experience
whatever perceptions you may attain to you are still surrounded by conditionsin space or in timeand you cannot discover anything unconditioned nor can you decide whether this unconditioned is to be placed in an absolute beginning of the synthesis or in an absolute totality of the series without beginning
a whole in the empirical signification of the term is always merely comparative
the absolute whole of quantity the universe of division of derivation of the condition of existence with the questionwhether it is to be produced by finite or infinite synthesis no possible experience can instruct us concerning
you will not for example be able to explain the phenomena of a body in the least degree better whether you believe it to consist of simple or of composite parts for a simple phenomenonand just as little an infinite series of compositioncan never be presented to your perception
phenomena require and admit of explanation only in so far as the conditions of that explanation are given in perception but the sum total of that which is given in phenomena considered as an absolute whole is itself a perceptionand we cannot therefore seek for explanations of this whole beyond itself in other perceptions
the explanation of this whole is the proper object of the transcendental problems of pure reason
although therefore the solution of these problems is unattainable through experience we must not permit ourselves to say that it is uncertain how the object of our inquiries is constituted
for the object is in our own mind and cannot be discovered in experience and we have only to take care that our thoughts are consistent with each other and to avoid falling into the amphiboly of regarding our idea as a representation of an object empirically given and therefore to be cognized according to the laws of experience
a dogmatical solution is therefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible
the critical solution which may be a perfectly certain one does not consider the question objectively but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the cognition upon which the question rests
section v
sceptical exposition of the cosmological problems presented in the four transcendental ideas
we should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmatical answer to our questions if we understood beforehand that be the answer what it may it would only serve to increase our ignorance to throw us from one incomprehensibility into another from one obscurity into another still greater and perhaps lead us into irreconcilable contradictions
if a dogmatical affirmative or negative answer is demanded is it at all prudent to set aside the probable grounds of a solution which lie before us and to take into consideration what advantage we shall gain if the answer is to favour the one side or the other if it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense we have in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical investigation of the question for the purpose of discovering whether it is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea the falsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application and consequences than in the mere representation of its content
this is the great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questions addressed by pure reason to itself
by this method we easily rid ourselves of the confusions of dogmatism and establish in its place a temperate criticism which as a genuine cathartic will successfully remove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their consequencethe vain pretension to universal science
if then i could understand the nature of a cosmological idea and perceive before i entered on the discussion of the subject at all that whatever side of the question regarding the unconditioned of the regressive synthesis of phenomena it favouredit must either be too great or too small for every conception of the understandingi would be able to comprehend how the idea which relates to an object of experiencean experience which must be adequate to and in accordance with a possible conception of the understandingmust be completely void and without significance inasmuch as its object is inadequate consider it as we may
and this is actually the case with all cosmological conceptions which for the reason above mentioned involve reason so long as it remains attached to them in an unavoidable antinomy
for suppose
first that the world has no beginningin this case it is too large for our conception for this conception which consists in a successive regress cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed
grant that it has a beginning it is then too small for the conception of the understanding
for as a beginning presupposes a time preceding it cannot be unconditioned and the law of the empirical employment of the understanding imposes the necessity of looking for a higher condition of time and the world is therefore evidently too small for this law
the same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding the extent in space of the world
for if it is infinite and unlimited it must be too large for every possible empirical conception
if it is finite and limited we have a right to ask what determines these limits void space is not a selfsubsistent correlate of things and cannot be a final conditionand still less an empirical condition forming a part of a possible experience
for how can we have any experience or perception of an absolute void but the absolute totality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned be an empirical conception
consequently a finite world is too small for our conception
secondly if every phenomenon matter in space consists of an infinite number of parts the regress of the division is always too great for our conception and if the division of space must cease with some member of the division the simple it is too small for the idea of the unconditioned
for the member at which we have discontinued our division still admits a regress to many more parts contained in the object
thirdly suppose that every event in the world happens in accordance with the laws of nature the causality of a cause must itself be an event and necessitates a regress to a still higher cause and consequently the unceasing prolongation of the series of conditions a parte priori
operative nature is therefore too large for every conception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events
if we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events that is of free agency we are driven in our search for sufficient reasons on an unavoidable law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empirical law of causality and we find that any such totality of connection in our synthesis is too small for our necessary empirical conception
fourthly if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessary beingwhether it be the world or something in the world or the cause of the worldwe must place it in a time at an infinite distance from any given moment for otherwise it must be dependent on some other and higher existence
such an existence is in this case too large for our empirical conception and unattainable by the continued regress of any synthesis
but if we believe that everything in the worldbe it condition or conditionedis contingent every given existence is too small for our conception
for in this case we are compelled to seek for some other existence upon which the former depends
we have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either too great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis and consequently for every possible conception of the understanding
why did we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this and instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or of falling short of its true aim possible experience say that in the first case the empirical conception is always too small for the idea and in the second too great and thus attach the blame of these contradictions to the empirical regress the reason is this
possible experience can alone give reality to our conceptions without it a conception is merely an idea without truth or relation to an object
hence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we are to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction of thought or whether it relates to an object in the world
if we say of a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too small the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter and requiring to be adapted to it
among the trivial subjects of discussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question if a ball cannot pass through a hole shall we say that the ball is too large or the hole too small in this case it is indifferent what expression we employ for we do not know which exists for the sake of the other
on the other hand we cannot say the man is too long for his coat but the coat is too short for the man
we are thus led to the wellfounded suspicion that the cosmological ideas and all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected with them are based upon a false and fictitious conception of the mode in which the object of these ideas is presented to us and this suspicion will probably direct us how to expose the illusion that has so long led us astray from the truth
section vi
transcendental idealism as the key to the solution of pure cosmological dialectic
in the transcendental sthetic we proved that everything intuited in space and time all objects of a possible experience are nothing but phenomena that is mere representations and that these as presented to usas extended bodies or as series of changeshave no selfsubsistent existence apart from human thought
this doctrine i call transcendental idealism
the realist in the transcendental sense regards these modifications of our sensibility these mere representations as things subsisting in themselves
i have elsewhere termed this theory formal idealism to distinguish it from material idealism which doubts or denies the existence of external things
to avoid ambiguity it seems advisable in many cases to employ this term instead of that mentioned in the text
it would be unjust to accuse us of holding the longdecried theory of empirical idealism which while admitting the reality of space denies or at least doubts the existence of bodies extended in it and thus leaves us without a sufficient criterion of reality and illusion
the supporters of this theory find no difficulty in admitting the reality of the phenomena of the internal sense in time nay they go the length of maintaining that this internal experience is of itself a sufficient proof of the real existence of its object as a thing in itself
transcendental idealism allows that the objects of external intuitionas intuited in space and all changes in timeas represented by the internal sense are real
for as space is the form of that intuition which we call external and without objects in space no empirical representation could be given us we can and ought to regard extended bodies in it as real
the case is the same with representations in time
but time and space with all phenomena therein are not in themselves things
they are nothing but representations and cannot exist out of and apart from the mind
nay the sensuous internal intuition of the mind as the object of consciousness the determination of which is represented by the succession of different states in time is not the real proper self as it exists in itselfnot the transcendental subjectbut only a phenomenon which is presented to the sensibility of this to us unknown being
this internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be a selfsubsisting thing for its condition is time and time cannot be the condition of a thing in itself
but the empirical truth of phenomena in space and time is guaranteed beyond the possibility of doubt and sufficiently distinguished from the illusion of dreams or fancyalthough both have a proper and thorough connection in an experience according to empirical laws
the objects of experience then are not things in themselves but are given only in experience and have no existence apart from and independently of experience
that there may be inhabitants in the moon although no one has ever observed them must certainly be admitted but this assertion means only that we may in the possible progress of experience discover them at some future time
for that which stands in connection with a perception according to the laws of the progress of experience is real
they are therefore really existent if they stand in empirical connection with my actual or real consciousness although they are not in themselves real that is apart from the progress of experience
there is nothing actually givenwe can be conscious of nothing as real except a perception and the empirical progression from it to other possible perceptions
for phenomena as mere representations are real only in perception and perception is in fact nothing but the reality of an empirical representation that is a phenomenon
to call a phenomenon a real thing prior to perception means either that we must meet with this phenomenon in the progress of experience or it means nothing at all
for i can say only of a thing in itself that it exists without relation to the senses and experience
but we are speaking here merely of phenomena in space and time both of which are determinations of sensibility and not of things in themselves
it follows that phenomena are not things in themselves but are mere representations which if not given in usin perceptionare nonexistent
the faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivitya capacity of being affected in a certain manner by representations the relation of which to each other is a pure intuition of space and timethe pure forms of sensibility
these representations in so far as they are connected and determinable in this relation in space and time according to laws of the unity of experience are called objects
the nonsensuous cause of these representations is completely unknown to us and hence cannot be intuited as an object
for such an object could not be represented either in space or in time and without these conditions intuition or representation is impossible
we may at the same time term the nonsensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental objectbut merely as a mental correlate to sensibility considered as a receptivity
to this transcendental object we may attribute the whole connection and extent of our possible perceptions and say that it is given and exists in itself prior to all experience
but the phenomena corresponding to it are not given as things in themselves but in experience alone
for they are mere representations receiving from perceptions alone significance and relation to a real object under the condition that this or that perceptionindicating an objectis in complete connection with all others in accordance with the rules of the unity of experience
thus we can say the things that really existed in past time are given in the transcendental object of experience
but these are to me real objects only in so far as i can represent to my own mind that a regressive series of possible perceptionsfollowing the indications of history or the footsteps of cause and effectin accordance with empirical lawsthat in one word the course of the world conducts us to an elapsed series of time as the condition of the present time
this series in past time is represented as real not in itself but only in connection with a possible experience
thus when i say that certain events occurred in past time i merely assert the possibility of prolonging the chain of experience from the present perception upwards to the conditions that determine it according to time
if i represent to myself all objects existing in all space and time i do not thereby place these in space and time prior to all experience on the contrary such a representation is nothing more than the notion of a possible experience in its absolute completeness
in experience alone are those objects which are nothing but representations given
but when i say they existed prior to my experience this means only that i must begin with the perception present to me and follow the track indicated until i discover them in some part or region of experience
the cause of the empirical condition of this progressionand consequently at what member therein i must stop and at what point in the regress i am to find this memberis transcendental and hence necessarily incognizable
but with this we have not to do our concern is only with the law of progression in experience in which objects that is phenomena are given
it is a matter of indifference whether i say i may in the progress of experience discover stars at a hundred times greater distance than the most distant of those now visible or stars at this distance may be met in space although no one has or ever will discover them
for if they are given as things in themselves without any relation to possible experience they are for me nonexistent consequently are not objects for they are not contained in the regressive series of experience
but if these phenomena must be employed in the construction or support of the cosmological idea of an absolute whole and when we are discussing a question that oversteps the limits of possible experience the proper distinction of the different theories of the reality of sensuous objects is of great importance in order to avoid the illusion which must necessarily arise from the misinterpretation of our empirical conceptions
section vii
critical solution of the cosmological problem
the antinomy of pure reason is based upon the following dialectical argument if that which is conditioned is given the whole series of its conditions is also given but sensuous objects are given as conditioned consequently
this syllogism the major of which seems so natural and evident introduces as many cosmological ideas as there are different kinds of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena in so far as these conditions constitute a series
these ideas require absolute totality in the series and thus place reason in inextricable embarrassment
before proceeding to expose the fallacy in this dialectical argument it will be necessary to have a correct understanding of certain conceptions that appear in it
in the first place the following proposition is evident and indubitably certain if the conditioned is given a regress in the series of all its conditions is thereby imperatively required
for the very conception of a conditioned is a conception of something related to a condition and if this condition is itself conditioned to another conditionand so on through all the members of the series
this proposition is therefore analytical and has nothing to fear from transcendental criticism
it is a logical postulate of reason to pursue as far as possible the connection of a conception with its conditions
if in the second place both the conditioned and the condition are things in themselves and if the former is given not only is the regress to the latter requisite but the latter is really given with the former
now as this is true of all the members of the series the entire series of conditions and with them the unconditioned is at the same time given in the very fact of the conditioned the existence of which is possible only in and through that series being given
in this case the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition is a synthesis of the understanding merely which represents things as they are without regarding whether and how we can cognize them
but if i have to do with phenomena which in their character of mere representations are not given if i do not attain to a cognition of them in other words to themselves for they are nothing more than empirical cognitions i am not entitled to say if the conditioned is given all its conditions as phenomena are also given
i cannot therefore from the fact of a conditioned being given infer the absolute totality of the series of its conditions
for phenomena are nothing but an empirical synthesis in apprehension or perception and are therefore given only in it
now in speaking of phenomena it does not follow that if the conditioned is given the synthesis which constitutes its empirical condition is also thereby given and presupposed such a synthesis can be established only by an actual regress in the series of conditions
but we are entitled to say in this case that a regress to the conditions of a conditioned in other words that a continuous empirical synthesis is enjoined that if the conditions are not given they are at least required and that we are certain to discover the conditions in this regress
we can now see that the major in the above cosmological syllogism takes the conditioned in the transcendental signification which it has in the pure category while the minor speaks of it in the empirical signification which it has in the category as applied to phenomena
there is therefore a dialectical fallacy in the syllogisma sophisma figurae dictionis
but this fallacy is not a consciously devised one but a perfectly natural illusion of the common reason of man
for when a thing is given as conditioned we presuppose in the major its conditions and their series unperceived as it were and unseen because this is nothing more than the logical requirement of complete and satisfactory premisses for a given conclusion
in this case time is altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with the condition they are supposed to be given in themselves and contemporaneously
it is moreover just as natural to regard phenomena in the minor as things in themselves and as objects presented to the pure understanding as in the major in which complete abstraction was made of all conditions of intuition
but it is under these conditions alone that objects are given
now we overlooked a remarkable distinction between the conceptions
the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition and the complete series of the latter in the major are not limited by time and do not contain the conception of succession
on the contrary the empirical synthesis and the series of conditions in the phenomenal worldsubsumed in the minorare necessarily successive and given in time alone
it follows that i cannot presuppose in the minor as i did in the major the absolute totality of the synthesis and of the series therein represented for in the major all the members of the series are given as things in themselveswithout any limitations or conditions of time while in the minor they are possible only in and through a successive regress which cannot exist except it be actually carried into execution in the world of phenomena
after this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employed in maintaining cosmological assertions both parties may now be justly dismissed as advancing claims without grounds or title
but the process has not been ended by convincing them that one or both were in the wrong and had maintained an assertion which was without valid grounds of proof
nothing seems to be clearer than that if one maintains the world has a beginning and another the world has no beginning one of the two must be right
but it is likewise clear that if the evidence on both sides is equal it is impossible to discover on what side the truth lies and the controversy continues although the parties have been recommended to peace before the tribunal of reason
there remains then no other means of settling the question than to convince the parties who refute each other with such conclusiveness and ability that they are disputing about nothing and that a transcendental illusion has been mocking them with visions of reality where there is none
the mode of adjusting a dispute which cannot be decided upon its own merits we shall now proceed to lay before our readers
zeno of elea a subtle dialectician was severely reprimanded by plato as a sophist who merely from the base motive of exhibiting his skill in discussion maintained and subverted the same proposition by arguments as powerful and convincing on the one side as on the other
he maintained for example that god who was probably nothing more in his view than the world is neither finite nor infinite neither in motion nor in rest neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing
it seemed to those philosophers who criticized his mode of discussion that his purpose was to deny completely both of two selfcontradictory propositionswhich is absurd
but i cannot believe that there is any justice in this accusation
the first of these propositions i shall presently consider in a more detailed manner
with regard to the others if by the word of god he understood merely the universe his meaning must have beenthat it cannot be permanently present in one placethat is at restnor be capable of changing its placethat is of movingbecause all places are in the universe and the universe itself is therefore in no place
again if the universe contains in itself everything that exists it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any other thing because there is in fact no other thing with which it can be compared
if two opposite judgements presuppose a contingent impossible or arbitrary condition bothin spite of their opposition which is however not properly or really a contradictionfall away because the condition which ensured the validity of both has itself disappeared
if we say everybody has either a good or a bad smell we have omitted a third possible judgementit has no smell at all and thus both conflicting statements may be false
if we say it is either goodsmelling or not goodsmelling vel suaveolens vel nonsuaveolens both judgements are contradictorily opposed and the contradictory opposite of the former judgementsome bodies are not goodsmellingembraces also those bodies which have no smell at all
in the preceding pair of opposed judgements per disparata the contingent condition of the conception of body smell attached to both conflicting statements instead of having been omitted in the latter which is consequently not the contradictory opposite of the former
if accordingly we say the world is either infinite in extension or it is not infinite non est infinitus and if the former proposition is false its contradictory oppositethe world is not infinitemust be true
and thus i should deny the existence of an infinite without however affirming the existence of a finite world
but if we construct our proposition thus the world is either infinite or finite noninfinite both statements may be false
for in this case we consider the world as per se determined in regard to quantity and while in the one judgement we deny its infinite and consequently perhaps its independent existence in the other we append to the world regarded as a thing in itself a certain determinationthat of finitude and the latter may be false as well as the former if the world is not given as a thing in itself and thus neither as finite nor as infinite in quantity
this kind of opposition i may be allowed to term dialectical that of contradictories may be called analytical opposition
thus then of two dialectically opposed judgements both may be false from the fact that the one is not a mere contradictory of the other but actually enounces more than is requisite for a full and complete contradiction
when we regard the two propositionsthe world is infinite in quantity and the world is finite in quantity as contradictory opposites we are assuming that the worldthe complete series of phenomenais a thing in itself
for it remains as a permanent quantity whether i deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of its phenomena
but if we dismiss this assumptionthis transcendental illusionand deny that it is a thing in itself the contradictory opposition is metamorphosed into a merely dialectical one and the world as not existing in itselfindependently of the regressive series of my representationsexists in like manner neither as a whole which is infinite nor as a whole which is finite in itself
the universe exists for me only in the empirical regress of the series of phenomena and not per se
if then it is always conditioned it is never completely or as a whole and it is therefore not an unconditioned whole and does not exist as such either with an infinite or with a finite quantity
what we have here said of the first cosmological ideathat of the absolute totality of quantity in phenomenaapplies also to the others
the series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive synthesis itself and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in itselfgiven prior to all regress
hence i am compelled to say the aggregate of parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finite nor infinite and these parts are given only in the regressive synthesis of decompositiona synthesis which is never given in absolute completeness either as finite or as infinite
the same is the case with the series of subordinated causes or of the conditioned up to the unconditioned and necessary existence which can never be regarded as in itself and in its totality either as finite or as infinite because as a series of subordinate representations it subsists only in the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previously to this regress or as a selfsubsistent series of things
thus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears
for the above demonstration has established the fact that it is merely the product of a dialectical and illusory opposition which arises from the application of the idea of absolute totalityadmissible only as a condition of things in themselvesto phenomena which exist only in our representations andwhen constituting a seriesin a successive regress
this antinomy of reason may however be really profitable to our speculative interests not in the way of contributing any dogmatical addition but as presenting to us another material support in our critical investigations
for it furnishes us with an indirect proof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena if our minds were not completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in the trancendental sthetic
the proof would proceed in the following dilemma
if the world is a whole existing in itself it must be either finite or infinite
but it is neither finite nor infiniteas has been shown on the one side by the thesis on the other by the antithesis
therefore the worldthe content of all phenomenais not a whole existing in itself
it follows that phenomena are nothing apart from our representations
and this is what we mean by transcendental ideality
this remark is of some importance
it enables us to see that the proofs of the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistriesare not fallacious but grounded on the nature of reason and validunder the supposition that phenomena are things in themselves
the opposition of the judgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the initial supposition and thus helps us to discover the true constitution of objects of sense
this transcendental dialectic does not favour scepticism although it presents us with a triumphant demonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method the great utility of which is apparent in the antinomy where the arguments of reason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force
and although the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we expectedalthough we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to metaphysical sciencewe have still reaped a great advantage in the correction of our judgements on these subjects of thought
section viii
regulative principle of pure reason in relation to the cosmological ideas
the cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain knowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the world of sense considered as a thing in itself
the actual regress in the series is the only means of approaching this maximum
this principle of pure reason therefore may still be considered as validnot as an axiom enabling us to cogitate totality in the object as actual but as a problem for the understanding which requires it to institute and to continue in conformity with the idea of totality in the mind the regress in the series of the conditions of a given conditioned
for in the world of sense that is in space and time every condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena is itself conditioned because sensuous objects are not things in themselves in which case an absolutely unconditioned might be reached in the progress of cognition but are merely empirical representations the conditions of which must always be found in intuition
the principle of reason is therefore properly a mere ruleprescribing a regress in the series of conditions for given phenomena and prohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely unconditioned
it is therefore not a principle of the possibility of experience or of the empirical cognition of sensuous objectsconsequently not a principle of the understanding for every experience is confined within certain proper limits determined by the given intuition
still less is it a constitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend our conception of the sensuous world beyond all possible experience
it is merely a principle for the enlargement and extension of experience as far as is possible for human faculties
it forbids us to consider any empirical limits as absolute
it is hence a principle of reason which as a rule dictates how we ought to proceed in our empirical regress but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior to the empirical regress what is given in the object itself
i have termed it for this reason a regulative principle of reason while the principle of the absolute totality of the series of conditions as existing in itself and given in the object is a constitutive cosmological principle
this distinction will at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutive principle and prevent us from attributing by a transcendental subreptio objective reality to an idea which is valid only as a rule
in order to understand the proper meaning of this rule of pure reason we must notice first that it cannot tell us what the object is but only how the empirical regress is to be proceeded with in order to attain to the complete conception of the object
if it gave us any information in respect to the former statement it would be a constitutive principlea principle impossible from the nature of pure reason
it will not therefore enable us to establish any such conclusions as the series of conditions for a given conditioned is in itself finite or it is infinite
for in this case we should be cogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality an object which is not and cannot be given in experience inasmuch as we should be attributing a reality objective and independent of the empirical synthesis to a series of phenomena
this idea of reason cannot then be regarded as validexcept as a rule for the regressive synthesis in the series of conditions according to which we must proceed from the conditioned through all intermediate and subordinate conditions up to the unconditioned although this goal is unattained and unattainable
for the absolutely unconditioned cannot be discovered in the sphere of experience
we now proceed to determine clearly our notion of a synthesis which can never be complete
there are two terms commonly employed for this purpose
these terms are regarded as expressions of different and distinguishable notions although the ground of the distinction has never been clearly exposed
the term employed by the mathematicians is progressus in infinitum
the philosophers prefer the expression progressus in indefinitum
without detaining the reader with an examination of the reasons for such a distinction or with remarks on the right or wrong use of the terms i shall endeavour clearly to determine these conceptions so far as is necessary for the purpose in this critique
we may with propriety say of a straight line that it may be produced to infinity
in this case the distinction between a progressus in infinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety
for although when we say produce a straight line it is more correct to say in indefinitum than in infinitum because the former means produce it as far as you please the second you must not cease to produce it the expression in infinitum is when we are speaking of the power to do it perfectly correct for we can always make it longer if we pleaseon to infinity
and this remark holds good in all cases when we speak of a progressus that is an advancement from the condition to the conditioned this possible advancement always proceeds to infinity
we may proceed from a given pair in the descending line of generation from father to son and cogitate a neverending line of descendants from it
for in such a case reason does not demand absolute totality in the series because it does not presuppose it as a condition and as given datum but merely as conditioned and as capable of being given dabile
very different is the case with the problem how far the regress which ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions must extend whether i can say it is a regress in infinitum or only in indefinitum and whether for example setting out from the human beings at present alive in the world i may ascend in the series of their ancestors in infinitumor whether all that can be said is that so far as i have proceeded i have discovered no empirical ground for considering the series limited so that i am justified and indeed compelled to search for ancestors still further back although i am not obliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them
my answer to this question is if the series is given in empirical intuition as a whole the regress in the series of its internal conditions proceeds in infinitum but if only one member of the series is given from which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality the regress is possible only in indefinitum
for example the division of a portion of matter given within certain limitsof a body that isproceeds in infinitum
for as the condition of this whole is its part and the condition of the part a part of the part and so on and as in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned indivisible member of the series of conditions is not to be found there are no reasons or grounds in experience for stopping in the division but on the contrary the more remote members of the division are actually and empirically given prior to this division
that is to say the division proceeds to infinity
on the other hand the series of ancestors of any given human being is not given in its absolute totality in any experience and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical member of this series to one still higher and does not meet with any empirical limit presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of the series
but as the members of such a series are not contained in the empirical intuition of the whole prior to the regress this regress does not proceed to infinity but only in indefinitum that is we are called upon to discover other and higher members which are themselves always conditioned
in neither casethe regressus in infinitum nor the regressus in indefinitum is the series of conditions to be considered as actually infinite in the object itself
this might be true of things in themselves but it cannot be asserted of phenomena which as conditions of each other are only given in the empirical regress itself
hence the question no longer is what is the quantity of this series of conditions in itselfis it finite or infinite for it is nothing in itself but how is the empirical regress to be commenced and how far ought we to proceed with it and here a signal distinction in the application of this rule becomes apparent
if the whole is given empirically it is possible to recede in the series of its internal conditions to infinity
but if the whole is not given and can only be given by and through the empirical regress i can only say it is possible to infinity to proceed to still higher conditions in the series
in the first case i am justified in asserting that more members are empirically given in the object than i attain to in the regress of decomposition
in the second case i am justified only in saying that i can always proceed further in the regress because no member of the series is given as absolutely conditioned and thus a higher member is possible and an inquiry with regard to it is necessary
in the one case it is necessary to find other members of the series in the other it is necessary to inquire for others inasmuch as experience presents no absolute limitation of the regress
for either you do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empirical regress and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete or you do possess such a limitative perception in which case it is not a part of your series for that which limits must be distinct from that which is limited by it and it is incumbent you to continue your regress up to this condition and so on
these remarks will be placed in their proper light by their application in the following section
section ix
of the empirical use of the regulative principle of reason with regard to the cosmological ideas
we have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the conceptions of reason or of understanding
we have shown likewise that the demand of absolute totality in the series of conditions in the world of sense arises from a transcendental employment of reason resting on the opinion that phenomena are to be regarded as things in themselves
it follows that we are not required to answer the question respecting the absolute quantity of a serieswhether it is in itself limited or unlimited
we are only called upon to determine how far we must proceed in the empirical regress from condition to condition in order to discover in conformity with the rule of reason a full and correct answer to the questions proposed by reason itself
this principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the extension of a possible experienceits invalidity as a principle constitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently demonstrated
and thus too the antinomial conflict of reason with itself is completely put an end to inasmuch as we have not only presented a critical solution of the fallacy lurking in the opposite statements of reason but have shown the true meaning of the ideas which gave rise to these statements
the dialectical principle of reason has therefore been changed into a doctrinal principle
but in fact if this principle in the subjective signification which we have shown to be its only true sense may be guaranteed as a principle of the unceasing extension of the employment of our understanding its influence and value are just as great as if it were an axiom for the priori determination of objects
for such an axiom could not exert a stronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding the most widely expanded employment in the field of experience
i
solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the composition of phenomena in the universe
here as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems the ground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in our empirical regress no experience of an absolute limit and consequently no experience of a condition which is itself absolutely unconditioned is discoverable
and the truth of this proposition itself rests upon the consideration that such an experience must represent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere void on which our continued regress by means of perception must abutwhich is impossible
now this proposition which declares that every condition attained in the empirical regress must itself be considered empirically conditioned contains the rule in terminis which requires me to whatever extent i may have proceeded in the ascending series always to look for some higher member in the serieswhether this member is to become known to me through experience or not
nothing further is necessary then for the solution of the first cosmological problem than to decide whether in the regress to the unconditioned quantity of the universe as regards space and time this never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitum or indefinitum
the general representation which we form in our minds of the series of all past states or conditions of the world or of all the things which at present exist in it is itself nothing more than a possible empirical regress which is cogitatedalthough in an undetermined mannerin the mind and which gives rise to the conception of a series of conditions for a given object
now i have a conception of the universe but not an intuitionthat is not an intuition of it as a whole
thus i cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from the quantity or magnitude of the world and determine the former by means of the latter on the contrary i must first of all form a conception of the quantity or magnitude of the world from the magnitude of the empirical regress
but of this regress i know nothing more than that i ought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions to one still higher
but the quantity of the universe is not thereby determined and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in infinitum
such an affirmation would anticipate the members of the series which have not yet been reached and represent the number of them as beyond the grasp of any empirical synthesis it would consequently determine the cosmical quantity prior to the regress although only in a negative mannerwhich is impossible
for the world is not given in its totality in any intuition consequently its quantity cannot be given prior to the regress
it follows that we are unable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity in itselfnot even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum we must only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of the universe in conformity with the rule which determines the empirical regress in it
but this rule merely requires us never to admit an absolute limit to our serieshow far soever we may have proceeded in it but always on the contrary to subordinate every phenomenon to some other as its condition and consequently to proceed to this higher phenomenon
such a regress is therefore the regressus in indefinitum which as not determining a quantity in the object is clearly distinguishable from the regressus in infinitum
the cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the possible empirical regress upon which its conception is based
and as this regress cannot be a determinate infinite regress still less a determinate finite absolutely limited it is evident that we cannot regard the world as either finite or infinite because the regress which gives us the representation of the world is neither finite nor infinite
it follows from what we have said that we are not justified in declaring the world to be infinite in space or as regards past time
for this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical but we cannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an object of the senses
i cannot say the regress from a given perception to everything limited either in space or time proceeds in infinitum for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity neither can i say it is finite for an absolute limit is likewise impossible in experience
it follows that i am not entitled to make any assertion at all respecting the whole object of experiencethe world of sense i must limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or empirical knowledge is to be attained
to the question therefore respecting the cosmical quantity the first and negative answer is the world has no beginning in time and no absolute limit in space
for in the contrary case it would be limited by a void time on the one hand and by a void space on the other
now since the world as a phenomenon cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a thing in itself it must be possible for us to have a perception of this limitation by a void time and a void space
but such a perceptionsuch an experience is impossible because it has no content
consequently an absolute cosmical limit is empirically and therefore absolutely impossible
the reader will remark that the proof presented above is very different from the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of the first antinomy
in that demonstration it was taken for granted that the world is a thing in itselfgiven in its totality prior to all regress and a determined position in space and time was denied to itif it was not considered as occupying all time and all space
hence our conclusion differed from that given above for we inferred in the antithesis the actual infinity of the world
from this follows the affirmative answer the regress in the series of phenomenaas a determination of the cosmical quantity proceeds in indefinitum
this is equivalent to saying the world of sense has no absolute quantity but the empirical regress through which alone the world of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions rests upon a rule which requires it to proceed from every member of the series as conditioned to one still more remote whether through personal experience or by means of history or the chain of cause and effect and not to cease at any point in this extension of the possible empirical employment of the understanding
and this is the proper and only use which reason can make of its principles
the above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind of phenomena
it does not for example forbid us in our ascent from an individual human being through the line of his ancestors to expect that we shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair or to admit in the series of heavenly bodies a sun at the farthest possible distance from some centre
all that it demands is a perpetual progress from phenomena to phenomena even although an actual perception is not presented by them as in the case of our perceptions being so weak as that we are unable to become conscious of them since they nevertheless belong to possible experience
every beginning is in time and all limits to extension are in space
but space and time are in the world of sense
consequently phenomena in the world are conditionally limited but the world itself is not limited either conditionally or unconditionally
for this reason and because neither the world nor the cosmical series of conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given our conception of the cosmical quantity is given only in and through the regress and not prior to itin a collective intuition
but the regress itself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmical quantity and cannot therefore give us any determined conception of itstill less a conception of a quantity which is in relation to a certain standard infinite
the regress does not therefore proceed to infinity an infinity given but only to an indefinite extent for or the of presenting to us a quantityrealized only in and through the regress itself
ii
solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the division of a whole given in intuition
when i divide a whole which is given in intuition i proceed from a conditioned to its conditions
the division of the parts of the whole subdivisio or decompositio is a regress in the series of these conditions
the absolute totality of this series would be actually attained and given to the mind if the regress could arrive at simple parts
but if all the parts in a continuous decomposition are themselves divisible the division that is to say the regress proceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum because the conditions the parts are themselves contained in the conditioned and as the latter is given in a limited intuition the former are all given along with it
this regress cannot therefore be called a regressus in indefinitum as happened in the case of the preceding cosmological idea the regress in which proceeded from the conditioned to the conditions not given contemporaneously and along with it but discoverable only through the empirical regress
we are not however entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind which is divisible in infinitum that it consists of an infinite number of parts
for although all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole the whole division is not contained therein
the division is contained only in the progressing decompositionin the regress itself which is the condition of the possibility and actuality of the series
now as this regress is infinite all the members parts to which it attains must be contained in the given whole as an aggregate
but the complete series of division is not contained therein
for this series being infinite in succession and always incomplete cannot represent an infinite number of members and still less a composition of these members into a whole
to apply this remark to space
every limited part of space presented to intuition is a whole the parts of which are always spacesto whatever extent subdivided
every limited space is hence divisible to infinity
let us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed in limits that is a body
the divisibility of a body rests upon the divisibility of space which is the condition of the possibility of the body as an extended whole
a body is consequently divisible to infinity though it does not for that reason consist of an infinite number of parts
it certainly seems that as a body must be cogitated as substance in space the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as substance
for we may and ought to grant in the case of space that division or decomposition to any extent never can utterly annihilate composition that is to say the smallest part of space must still consist of spaces otherwise space would entirely cease to existwhich is impossible
but the assertion on the other hand that when all composition in matter is annihilated in thought nothing remains does not seem to harmonize with the conception of substance which must be properly the subject of all composition and must remain even after the conjunction of its attributes in spacewhich constituted a bodyis annihilated in thought
but this is not the case with substance in the phenomenal world which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure category
phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject it is merely a permanent sensuous image and nothing more than an intuition in which the unconditioned is not to be found
but although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate and applicable to the subdivision of a phenomenon as a mere occupation or filling of space it is not applicable to a whole consisting of a number of distinct parts and constituting a quantum discretumthat is to say an organized body
it cannot be admitted that every part in an organized whole is itself organized and that in analysing it to infinity we must always meet with organized parts although we may allow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in infinitum may be organized
for the infinity of the division of a phenomenon in space rests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon is given only in and through this infinity that is an undetermined number of parts is given while the parts themselves are given and determined only in and through the subdivision in a word the infinity of the division necessarily presupposes that the whole is not already divided in se
hence our division determines a number of parts in the wholea number which extends just as far as the actual regress in the division while on the other hand the very notion of a body organized to infinity represents the whole as already and in itself divided
we expect therefore to find in it a determinate but at the same time infinite number of partswhich is selfcontradictory
for we should thus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be completed in any regresswhich is infinite and at the same time complete in an organized composite
infinite divisibility is applicable only to a quantum continuum and is based entirely on the infinite divisibility of space but in a quantum discretum the multitude of parts or units is always determined and hence always equal to some number
to what extent a body may be organized experience alone can inform us and although so far as our experience of this or that body has extended we may not have discovered any inorganic part such parts must exist in possible experience
but how far the transcendental division of a phenomenon must extend we cannot know from experienceit is a question which experience cannot answer it is answered only by the principle of reason which forbids us to consider the empirical regress in the analysis of extended body as ever absolutely complete
concluding remark on the solution of the transcendental mathematical ideasand introductory to the solution of the dynamical ideas
we presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form and we endeavoured to show the ground of this selfcontradiction on the part of reason and the only means of bringing it to a conclusionnamely by declaring both contradictory statements to be false
we represented in these antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to the conditioned according to relations of space and timewhich is the usual supposition of the common understanding
in this respect all dialectical representations of totality in the series of conditions to a given conditioned were perfectly homogeneous
the condition was always a member of the series along with the conditioned and thus the homogeneity of the whole series was assured
in this case the regress could never be cogitated as complete or if this was the case a member really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member consequently as unconditioned
in such an antinomy therefore we did not consider the object that is the conditioned but the series of conditions belonging to the object and the magnitude of that series
and thus arose the difficultya difficulty not to be settled by any decision regarding the claims of the two parties but simply by cutting the knotby declaring the series proposed by reason to be either too long or too short for the understanding which could in neither case make its conceptions adequate with the ideas
but we have overlooked up to this point an essential difference existing between the conceptions of the understanding which reason endeavours to raise to the rank of ideastwo of these indicating a mathematical and two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena
hitherto it was necessary to signalize this distinction for just as in our general representation of all transcendental ideas we considered them under phenomenal conditions so in the two mathematical ideas our discussion is concerned solely with an object in the world of phenomena
but as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of the dynamical conceptions of the understanding and their adequateness with ideas we must not lose sight of this distinction
we shall find that it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which reason is involved
for while in the first two antinomies both parties were dismissed on the ground of having advanced statements based upon false hypothesis in the present case the hope appears of discovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the demands of reason and the judge completing the statement of the grounds of claim which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state the question may be settled on its own merits not by dismissing the claimants but by a comparison of the arguments on both sides
if we consider merely their extension and whether they are adequate with ideas the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous
but the conception of the understanding which lies at the basis of these ideas contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous presupposed in every quantityin its composition as well as in its division or of the heterogeneous which is the case in the dynamical synthesis of cause and effect as well as of the necessary and the contingent
thus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no other than a sensuous condition is admissiblea condition which is itself a member of the series while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions admits a heterogeneous condition which is not a member of the series but as purely intelligible lies out of and beyond it
and thus reason is satisfied and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series of phenomena without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it contrary to the principles of the understanding
now from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of phenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena arises a result which we should not have expected from an antinomy
in former cases the result was that both contradictory dialectical statements were declared to be false
in the present case we find the conditioned in the dynamical series connected with an empirically unconditioned but nonsensuous condition and thus satisfaction is done to the understanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other
while moreover the dialectical arguments for unconditioned totality in mere phenomena fall to the ground both propositions of reason may be shown to be true in their proper signification
this could not happen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded a mathematically unconditioned unity for no condition could be placed at the head of the series of phenomena except one which was itself a phenomenon and consequently a member of the series
for the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition which is itself empirically unconditioned
but if it is possible to cogitate an intelligible conditionone which is not a member of the series of phenomenafor a conditioned phenomenon without breaking the series of empirical conditions such a condition may be admissible as empirically unconditioned and the empirical regress continue regular unceasing and intact
iii
solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the deduction of cosmical events from their causes
there are only two modes of causality cogitablethe causality of nature or of freedom
the first is the conjunction of a particular state with another preceding it in the world of sense the former following the latter by virtue of a law
now as the causality of phenomena is subject to conditions of time and the preceding state if it had always existed could not have produced an effect which would make its first appearance at a particular time the causality of a cause must itself be an effectmust itself have begun to be and therefore according to the principle of the understanding itself requires a cause
we must understand on the contrary by the term freedom in the cosmological sense a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a state the causality of which therefore is not subordinated to another cause determining it in time
freedom is in this sense a pure transcendental idea which in the first place contains no empirical element the object of which in the second place cannot be given or determined in any experience because it is a universal law of the very possibility of experience that everything which happens must have a cause that consequently the causality of a cause being itself something that has happened must also have a cause
in this view of the case the whole field of experience how far soever it may extend contains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature
but as we cannot by this means attain to an absolute totality of conditions in reference to the series of causes and effects reason creates the idea of a spontaneity which can begin to act of itself and without any external cause determining it to action according to the natural law of causality
it is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom is based upon the transcendental idea and that the question of the possibility of the former is difficult only as it involves the consideration of the truth of the latter
freedom in the practical sense is the independence of the will of coercion by sensuous impulses
a will is sensuous in so far as it is pathologically affected by sensuous impulses it is termed animal arbitrium brutum when it is pathologically necessitated
the human will is certainly an arbitrium sensitivum not brutum but liberum because sensuousness does not necessitate its action a faculty existing in man of selfdetermination independently of all sensuous coercion
it is plain that if all causality in the world of sense were naturaland natural onlyevery event would be determined by another according to necessary laws and that consequently phenomena in so far as they determine the will must necessitate every action as a natural effect from themselves and thus all practical freedom would fall to the ground with the transcendental idea
for the latter presupposes that although a certain thing has not happened it ought to have happened and that consequently its phenomenal cause was not so powerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our willa causality capable of producing effects independently of and even in opposition to the power of natural causes and capable consequently of spontaneously originating a series of events
here too we find it to be the case as we generally found in the selfcontradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to pass the bounds of possible experience that the problem is properly not physiological but transcendental
the question of the possibility of freedom does indeed concern psychology but as it rests upon dialectical arguments of pure reason its solution must engage the attention of transcendental philosophy
before attempting this solution a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline it will be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in the settlement of the question
if phenomena were things in themselves and time and space forms of the existence of things condition and conditioned would always be members of the same series and thus would arise in the present case the antinomy common to all transcendental ideasthat their series is either too great or too small for the understanding
the dynamical ideas which we are about to discuss in this and the following section possess the peculiarity of relating to an object not considered as a quantity but as an existence and thus in the discussion of the present question we may make abstraction of the quantity of the series of conditions and consider merely the dynamical relation of the condition to the conditioned
the question then suggests itself whether freedom is possible and if it is whether it can consist with the universality of the natural law of causality and consequently whether we enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say every effect must have its origin either in nature or in freedom or whether both cannot exist together in the same event in different relations
the principle of an unbroken connection between all events in the phenomenal world in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature is a wellestablished principle of transcendental analytic which admits of no exception
the question therefore is whether an effect determined according to the laws of nature can at the same time be produced by a free agent or whether freedom and nature mutually exclude each other and here the common but fallacious hypothesis of the absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious influence in embarrassing the procedure of reason
for if phenomena are things in themselves freedom is impossible
in this case nature is the complete and allsufficient cause of every event and condition and conditioned cause and effect are contained in the same series and necessitated by the same law
if on the contrary phenomena are held to be as they are in fact nothing more than mere representations connected with each other in accordance with empirical laws they must have a ground which is not phenomenal
but the causality of such an intelligible cause is not determined or determinable by phenomena although its effects as phenomena must be determined by other phenomenal existences
this cause and its causality exist therefore out of and apart from the series of phenomena while its effects do exist and are discoverable in the series of empirical conditions
such an effect may therefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligible cause and necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is a necessary consequencea distinction which stated in this perfectly general and abstract manner must appear in the highest degree subtle and obscure
the sequel will explain
it is sufficient at present to remark that as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an unalterable law of nature freedom is impossibleon the supposition that phenomena are absolutely real
hence those philosophers who adhere to the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconciling the ideas of nature and freedom
possibility of freedom in harmony with the universal law of natural necessity
that element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous i may be allowed to term intelligible
if accordingly an object which must be regarded as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is not an object of sensuous intuition but by means of which it is capable of being the cause of phenomena the causality of an object or existence of this kind may be regarded from two different points of view
it may be considered to be intelligible as regards its actionthe action of a thing which is a thing in itself and sensuous as regards its effectsthe effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world
we should accordingly have to form both an empirical and an intellectual conception of the causality of such a faculty or powerboth however having reference to the same effect
this twofold manner of cogitating a power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any of the conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or of a possible experience
phenomenanot being things in themselvesmust have a transcendental object as a foundation which determines them as mere representations and there seems to be no reason why we should not ascribe to this transcendental object in addition to the property of selfphenomenization a causality whose effects are to be met with in the world of phenomena although it is not itself a phenomenon
but every effective cause must possess a character that is to say a law of its causality without which it would cease to be a cause
in the above case then every sensuous object would possess an empirical character which guaranteed that its actions as phenomena stand in complete and harmonious connection conformably to unvarying natural laws with all other phenomena and can be deduced from these as conditions and that they do thus in connection with these constitute a series in the order of nature
this sensuous object must in the second place possess an intelligible character which guarantees it to be the cause of those actions as phenomena although it is not itself a phenomenon nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense
the former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon the latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself
now this active subject would in its character of intelligible subject be subordinate to no conditions of time for time is only a condition of phenomena and not of things in themselves
no action would begin or cease to be in this subject it would consequently be free from the law of all determination of timethe law of change namely that everything which happens must have a cause in the phenomena of a preceding state
in one word the causality of the subject in so far as it is intelligible would not form part of the series of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an event in the world of sense
again this intelligible character of a thing cannot be immediately cognized because we can perceive nothing but phenomena but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony with the empirical character for we always find ourselves compelled to place in thought a transcendental object at the basis of phenomena although we can never know what this object is in itself
in virtue of its empirical character this subject would at the same time be subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality and as a phenomenon and member of the sensuous world its effects would have to be accounted for by a reference to preceding phenomena
eternal phenomena must be capable of influencing it and its actions in accordance with natural laws must explain to us how its empirical character that is the law of its causality is to be cognized in and by means of experience
in a word all requisites for a complete and necessary determination of these actions must be presented to us by experience
in virtue of its intelligible character on the other hand although we possess only a general conception of this character the subject must be regarded as free from all sensuous influences and from all phenomenal determination
moreover as nothing happens in this subjectfor it is a noumenon and there does not consequently exist in it any change demanding the dynamical determination of time and for the same reason no connection with phenomena as causesthis active existence must in its actions be free from and independent of natural necessity for this necessity exists only in the world of phenomena
it would be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effects in the world of sense from itself although the action productive of these effects does not begin in itself
we should not be in this case affirming that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves because they are always determined by prior empirical conditionsby virtue of the empirical character which is the phenomenon of the intelligible characterand are possible only as constituting a continuation of the series of natural causes
and thus nature and freedom each in the complete and absolute signification of these terms can exist without contradiction or disagreement in the same action
exposition of the cosmological idea of freedom in harmony with the universal law of natural necessity
i have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely a sketch of the solution of this transcendental problem in order to enable him to form with greater ease a clear conception of the course which reason must adopt in the solution
i shall now proceed to exhibit the several momenta of this solution and to consider them in their order
the natural law that everything which happens must have a cause that the causality of this cause that is the action of the cause which cannot always have existed but must be itself an event for it precedes in time some effect which it has originated must have itself a phenomenal cause by which it is determined and and consequently all events are empirically determined in an order of naturethis law i say which lies at the foundation of the possibility of experience and of a connected system of phenomena or nature is a law of the understanding from which no departure and to which no exception can be admitted
for to except even a single phenomenon from its operation is to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to admit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain
thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes in which however absolute totality cannot be found
but we need not detain ourselves with this question for it has already been sufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into which reason falls when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the series of phenomena
if we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion of transcendental idealism we shall find that neither nature nor freedom exists
now the question is whether admitting the existence of natural necessity in the world of phenomena it is possible to consider an effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an effect of freedomor whether these two modes of causality are contradictory and incompatible
no phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series
every action in so far as it is productive of an event is itself an event or occurrence and presupposes another preceding state in which its cause existed
thus everything that happens is but a continuation of a series and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world
the actions of natural causes are accordingly themselves effects and presuppose causes preceding them in time
a primal action which forms an absolute beginning is beyond the causal power of phenomena
now is it absolutely necessary that granting that all effects are phenomena the causality of the cause of these effects must also be a phenomenon and belong to the empirical world is it not rather possible that although every effect in the phenomenal world must be connected with an empirical cause according to the universal law of nature this empirical causality may be itself the effect of a nonempirical and intelligible causalityits connection with natural causes remaining nevertheless intact such a causality would be considered in reference to phenomena as the primal action of a cause which is in so far therefore not phenomenal but by reason of this faculty or power intelligible although it must at the same time as a link in the chain of nature be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world
a belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary if we are required to look for and to present the natural conditions of natural events that is to say their causes
this being admitted as unexceptionably valid the requirements of the understanding which recognizes nothing but nature in the region of phenomena are satisfied and our physical explanations of physical phenomena may proceed in their regular course without hindrance and without opposition
but it is no stumblingblock in the way even assuming the idea to be a pure fiction to admit that there are some natural causes in the possession of a faculty which is not empirical but intelligible inasmuch as it is not determined to action by empirical conditions but purely and solely upon grounds brought forward by the understandingthis action being still when the cause is phenomenized in perfect accordance with the laws of empirical causality
thus the acting subject as a causal phenomenon would continue to preserve a complete connection with nature and natural conditions and the phenomenon only of the subject with all its phenomenal causality would contain certain conditions which if we ascend from the empirical to the transcendental object must necessarily be regarded as intelligible
for if we attend in our inquiries with regard to causes in the world of phenomena to the directions of nature alone we need not trouble ourselves about the relation in which the transcendental subject which is completely unknown to us stands to these phenomena and their connection in nature
the intelligible ground of phenomena in this subject does not concern empirical questions
it has to do only with pure thought and although the effects of this thought and action of the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena these phenomena must nevertheless be capable of a full and complete explanation upon purely physical grounds and in accordance with natural laws
and in this case we attend solely to their empirical and omit all consideration of their intelligible character which is the transcendental cause of the former as completely unknown except in so far as it is exhibited by the latter as its empirical symbol
now let us apply this to experience
man is a phenomenon of the sensuous world and at the same time therefore a natural cause the causality of which must be regulated by empirical laws
as such he must possess an empirical character like all other natural phenomena
we remark this empirical character in his actions which reveal the presence of certain powers and faculties
if we consider inanimate or merely animal nature we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other than a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner
but man to whom nature reveals herself only through sense cognizes himself not only by his senses but also through pure apperception and this in actions and internal determinations which he cannot regard as sensuous impressions
he is thus to himself on the one hand a phenomenon but on the other hand in respect of certain faculties a purely intelligible objectintelligible because its action cannot be ascribed to sensuous receptivity
these faculties are understanding and reason
the latter especially is in a peculiar manner distinct from all empiricallyconditioned faculties for it employs ideas alone in the consideration of its objects and by means of these determines the understanding which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its own conceptions which like the ideas of reason are pure and nonempirical
that reason possesses the faculty of causality or that at least we are compelled so to represent it is evident from the imperatives which in the sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers
the words i ought express a species of necessity and imply a connection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to the mind of man
understanding knows nothing in nature but that which is or has been or will be
it would be absurd to say that anything in nature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in which it stands indeed the ought when we consider merely the course of nature has neither application nor meaning
the question what ought to happen in the sphere of nature is just as absurd as the question what ought to be the properties of a circle all that we are entitled to ask is what takes place in nature or in the latter case what are the properties of a circle
but the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action the ground of which is a pure conception while the ground of a merely natural action is on the contrary always a phenomenon
this action must certainly be possible under physical conditions if it is prescribed by the moral imperative ought but these physical or natural conditions do not concern the determination of the will itself they relate to its effects alone and the consequences of the effect in the world of phenomena
whatever number of motives nature may present to my will whatever sensuous impulsesthe moral ought it is beyond their power to produce
they may produce a volition which so far from being necessary is always conditioneda volition to which the ought enunciated by reason sets an aim and a standard gives permission or prohibition
be the object what it may purely sensuousas pleasure or presented by pure reasonas good reason will not yield to grounds which have an empirical origin
reason will not follow the order of things presented by experience but with perfect spontaneity rearranges them according to ideas with which it compels empirical conditions to agree
it declares in the name of these ideas certain actions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place and which perhaps never will take place and yet presupposes that it possesses the faculty of causality in relation to these actions
for in the absence of this supposition it could not expect its ideas to produce certain effects in the world of experience
now let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason does stand in a really causal relation to phenomena
in this case it mustpure reason as it isexhibit an empirical character
for every cause supposes a rule according to which certain phenomena follow as effects from the cause and every rule requires uniformity in these effects and this is the proper ground of the conception of a causeas a faculty or power
now this conception of a cause may be termed the empirical character of reason and this character is a permanent one while the effects produced appear in conformity with the various conditions which accompany and partly limit them in various forms
thus the volition of every man has an empirical character which is nothing more than the causality of his reason in so far as its effects in the phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule according to which we are enabled to examine in their several kinds and degrees the actions of this causality and the rational grounds for these actions and in this way to decide upon the subjective principles of the volition
now we learn what this empirical character is only from phenomenal effects and from the rule of these which is presented by experience and for this reason all the actions of man in the world of phenomena are determined by his empirical character and the cooperative causes of nature
if then we could investigate all the phenomena of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind there would be no action which we could not anticipate with certainty and recognize to be absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions
so far as relates to this empirical character therefore there can be no freedom and it is only in the light of this character that we can consider the human will when we confine ourselves to simple observation and as is the case in anthropology institute a physiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions
but when we consider the same actions in relation to reasonnot for the purpose of explaining their origin that is in relation to speculative reason but to practical reason as the producing cause of these actionswe shall discover a rule and an order very different from those of nature and experience
for the declaration of this mental faculty may be that what has and could not but take place in the course of nature ought not to have taken place
sometimes too we discover or believe that we discover that the ideas of reason did actually stand in a causal relation to certain actions of man and that these actions have taken place because they were determined not by empirical causes but by the act of the will upon grounds of reason
now granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena can an action of reason be called free when we know that sensuously in its empirical character it is completely determined and absolutely necessary but this empirical character is itself determined by the intelligible character
the latter we cannot cognize we can only indicate it by means of phenomena which enable us to have an immediate cognition only of the empirical character
an action then in so far as it is to be ascribed to an intelligible cause does not result from it in accordance with empirical laws
that is to say not the conditions of pure reason but only their effects in the internal sense precede the act
pure reason as a purely intelligible faculty is not subject to the conditions of time
the causality of reason in its intelligible character does not begin to be it does not make its appearance at a certain time for the purpose of producing an effect
if this were not the case the causality of reason would be subservient to the natural law of phenomena which determines them according to time and as a series of causes and effects in time it would consequently cease to be freedom and become a part of nature
we are therefore justified in saying if reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena it is a faculty which originates the sensuous condition of an empirical series of effects
for the condition which resides in the reason is nonsensuous and therefore cannot be originated or begin to be
and thus we findwhat we could not discover in any empirical seriesa condition of a successive series of events itself empirically unconditioned
for in the present case the condition stands out of and beyond the series of phenomenait is intelligible and it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition or to any timedetermination by a preceding cause
the real morality of actionstheir merit or demerit and even that of our own conduct is completely unknown to us
our estimates can relate only to their empirical character
how much is the result of the action of free will how much is to be ascribed to nature and to blameless error or to a happy constitution of temperament merito fortunae no one can discover nor for this reason determine with perfect justice
but in another respect the same cause belongs also to the series of phenomena
man is himself a phenomenon
his will has an empirical character which is the empirical cause of all his actions
there is no conditiondetermining man and his volition in conformity with this characterwhich does not itself form part of the series of effects in nature and is subject to their lawthe law according to which an empirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist
for this reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous origination all actions being phenomena and belonging to the world of experience
but it cannot be said of reason that the state in which it determines the will is always preceded by some other state determining it
for reason is not a phenomenon and therefore not subject to sensuous conditions and consequently even in relation to its causality the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason nor can the dynamical law of nature which determines the sequence of time according to certain rules be applied to it
reason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of the human will
each of these is determined in the empirical character of the man even before it has taken place
the intelligible character of which the former is but the sensuous schema knows no before or after and every action irrespective of the timerelation in which it stands with other phenomena is the immediate effect of the intelligible character of pure reason which consequently enjoys freedom of action and is not dynamically determined either by internal or external preceding conditions
this freedom must not be described in a merely negative manner as independence of empirical conditions for in this case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena but it must be regarded positively as a faculty which can spontaneously originate a series of events
at the same time it must not be supposed that any beginning can take place in reason on the contrary reason as the unconditioned condition of all action of the will admits of no timeconditions although its effect does really begin in a series of phenomenaa beginning which is not however absolutely primal
i shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example from its employment in the world of experience proved it cannot be by any amount of experience or by any number of facts for such arguments cannot establish the truth of transcendental propositions
let us take a voluntary actionfor example a falsehoodby means of which a man has introduced a certain degree of confusion into the social life of humanity which is judged according to the motives from which it originated and the blame of which and of the evil consequences arising from it is imputed to the offender
we at first proceed to examine the empirical character of the offence and for this purpose we endeavour to penetrate to the sources of that character such as a defective education bad company a shameless and wicked disposition frivolity and want of reflectionnot forgetting also the occasioning causes which prevailed at the moment of the transgression
in this the procedure is exactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series of causes which determine a given physical effect
now although we believe the action to have been determined by all these circumstances we do not the less blame the offender
we do not blame him for his unhappy disposition nor for the circumstances which influenced him nay not even for his former course of life for we presuppose that all these considerations may be set aside that the series of preceding conditions may be regarded as having never existed and that the action may be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any state preceding just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely new series of effects
our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law of reason which requires us to regard this faculty as a cause which could have and ought to have otherwise determined the behaviour of the culprit independently of all empirical conditions
this causality of reason we do not regard as a cooperating agency but as complete in itself
it matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured or opposed the action of this causality the offence is estimated according to its intelligible characterthe offender is decidedly worthy of blame the moment he utters a falsehood
it follows that we regard reason in spite of the empirical conditions of the act as completely free and therefore as in the present case culpable
the above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed to think that reason is not affected by sensuous conditions that in it no change takes placealthough its phenomena in other words the mode in which it appears in its effects are subject to changethat in it no preceding state determines the following and consequently that it does not form a member of the series of sensuous conditions which necessitate phenomena according to natural laws
reason is present and the same in all human actions and at all times but it does not itself exist in time and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it did not formerly exist
it is relatively to new states or conditions determining but not determinable
hence we cannot ask why did not reason determine itself in a different manner the question ought to be thus stated why did not reason employ its power of causality to determine certain phenomena in a different manner but this is a question which admits of no answer
for a different intelligible character would have exhibited a different empirical character and when we say that in spite of the course which his whole former life has taken the offender could have refrained from uttering the falsehood this means merely that the act was subject to the power and authoritypermissive or prohibitiveof reason
now reason is not subject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time and a difference in time may produce a difference in the relation of phenomena to each otherfor these are not things and therefore not causes in themselvesbut it cannot produce any difference in the relation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason
thus then in our investigation into free actions and the causal power which produced them we arrive at an intelligible cause beyond which however we cannot go although we can recognize that it is free that is independent of all sensuous conditions and that in this way it may be the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena
but for what reason the intelligible character generates such and such phenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character under certain circumstances it is beyond the power of our reason to decide
the question is as much above the power and the sphere of reason as the following would be why does the transcendental object of our external sensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition in space but the problem which we were called upon to solve does not require us to entertain any such questions
the problem was merely thiswhether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition in the same action
to this question we have given a sufficient answer for we have shown that as the former stands in a relation to a different kind of condition from those of the latter the law of the one does not affect the law of the other and that consequently both can exist together in independence of and without interference with each other
the reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above remarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom as a faculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena
for not to mention that such an argument would not have a transcendental character nor have been limited to the discussion of pure conceptionsall attempts at inferring from experience what cannot be cogitated in accordance with its laws must ever be unsuccessful
nay more i have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility of freedom for this too would have been a vain endeavour inasmuch as it is beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a reality or of a causal power by the aid of mere priori conceptions
freedom has been considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendental idea by means of which reason aims at originating a series of conditions in the world of phenomena with the help of that which is sensuously unconditioned involving itself however in an antinomy with the laws which itself prescribes for the conduct of the understanding
that this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion and that nature and freedom are at least not opposedthis was the only thing in our power to prove and the question which it was our task to solve
iv
solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the dependence of phenomenal existences
in the preceding remarks we considered the changes in the world of sense as constituting a dynamical series in which each member is subordinated to anotheras its cause
our present purpose is to avail ourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to an existence which may be the highest condition of all changeable phenomena that is to a necessary being
our endeavour to reach not the unconditioned causality but the unconditioned existence of substance
the series before us is therefore a series of conceptions and not of intuitions in which the one intuition is the condition of the other
but it is evident that as all phenomena are subject to change and conditioned in their existence the series of dependent existences cannot embrace an unconditioned member the existence of which would be absolutely necessary
it follows that if phenomena were things in themselves andas an immediate consequence from this suppositioncondition and conditioned belonged to the same series of phenomena the existence of a necessary being as the condition of the existence of sensuous phenomena would be perfectly impossible
an important distinction however exists between the dynamical and the mathematical regress
the latter is engaged solely with the combination of parts into a whole or with the division of a whole into its parts and therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series and to be consequently regarded as homogeneous and for this reason as consisting without exception of phenomena
if the former regress on the contrary the aim of which is not to establish the possibility of an unconditioned whole consisting of given parts or of an unconditioned part of a given whole but to demonstrate the possibility of the deduction of a certain state from its cause or of the contingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily it is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empirical series along with the conditioned
in the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present dealing there exists a way of escape from the difficulty for it is not impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true in different relations
all sensuous phenomena may be contingent and consequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence and yet there may also exist a nonempirical condition of the whole series or in other words a necessary being
for this necessary being as an intelligible condition would not form a membernot even the highest memberof the series the whole world of sense would be left in its empirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced
this would also form a ground of distinction between the modes of solution employed for the third and fourth antinomies
for while in the consideration of freedom in the former antinomy the thing itselfthe cause substantia phaenomenonwas regarded as belonging to the series of conditions and only its causality to the intelligible worldwe are obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessary being as purely intelligible and as existing entirely apart from the world of sense as an ens extramundanum for otherwise it would be subject to the phenomenal law of contingency and dependence
in relation to the present problem therefore the regulative principle of reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses an empirically conditioned existencethat no property of the sensuous world possesses unconditioned necessitythat we are bound to expect and so far as is possible to seek for the empirical condition of every member in the series of conditionsand that there is no sufficient reason to justify us in deducing any existence from a condition which lies out of and beyond the empirical series or in regarding any existence as independent and selfsubsistent although this should not prevent us from recognizing the possibility of the whole series being based upon a being which is intelligible and for this reason free from all empirical conditions
but it has been far from my intention in these remarks to prove the existence of this unconditioned and necessary being or even to evidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the existence of all sensuous phenomena
as bounds were set to reason to prevent it from leaving the guiding thread of empirical conditions and losing itself in transcendent theories which are incapable of concrete presentation so it was my purpose on the other hand to set bounds to the law of the purely empirical understanding and to protest against any attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things or declaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible merely on the ground that it is not available for the explanation and exposition of phenomena
it has been shown at the same time that the contingency of all the phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quite consistent with the arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary although purely intelligible condition that no real contradiction exists between them and that consequently both may be true
the existence of such an absolutely necessary being may be impossible but this can never be demonstrated from the universal contingency and dependence of sensuous phenomena nor from the principle which forbids us to discontinue the series at some member of it or to seek for its cause in some sphere of existence beyond the world of nature
reason goes its way in the empirical world and follows too its peculiar path in the sphere of the transcendental
the sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena which are mere representations and always sensuously conditioned things in themselves are not and cannot be objects to us
it is not to be wondered at therefore that we are not justified in leaping from some member of an empirical series beyond the world of sense as if empirical representations were things in themselves existing apart from their transcendental ground in the human mind and the cause of whose existence may be sought out of the empirical series
this would certainly be the case with contingent things but it cannot be with mere representations of things the contingency of which is itself merely a phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that which determines phenomena that is the empirical
but to cogitate an intelligible ground of phenomena as free moreover from the contingency of the latter conflicts neither with the unlimited nature of the empirical regress nor with the complete contingency of phenomena
and the demonstration of this was the only thing necessary for the solution of this apparent antinomy
for if the condition of every conditionedas regards its existenceis sensuous and for this reason a part of the same series it must be itself conditioned as was shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy
the embarrassments into which a reason which postulates the unconditioned necessarily falls must therefore continue to exist or the unconditioned must be placed in the sphere of the intelligible
in this way its necessity does not require nor does it even permit the presence of an empirical condition and it is consequently unconditionally necessary
the empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption of a purely intelligible being it continues its operations on the principle of the contingency of all phenomena proceeding from empirical conditions to still higher and higher conditions themselves empirical
just as little does this regulative principle exclude the assumption of an intelligible cause when the question regards merely the pure employment of reasonin relation to ends or aims
for in this case an intelligible cause signifies merely the transcendental and to us unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous phenomena and its existence necessary and independent of all sensuous conditions is not inconsistent with the contingency of phenomena or with the unlimited possibility of regress which exists in the series of empirical conditions
concluding remarks on the antinomy of pure reason
so long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of conditions in the world of phenomena and the satisfaction from this source of the requirements of reason so long are our ideas transcendental and cosmological
but when we set the unconditionedwhich is the aim of all our inquiriesin a sphere which lies out of the world of sense and possible experience our ideas become transcendent
they are then not merely serviceable towards the completion of the exercise of reason which remains an idea never executed but always to be pursued they detach themselves completely from experience and construct for themselves objects the material of which has not been presented by experience and the objective reality of which is not based upon the completion of the empirical series but upon pure priori conceptions
the intelligible object of these transcendent ideas may be conceded as a transcendental object
but we cannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinct predicates relating to its internal nature for it has no connection with empirical conceptions nor are we justified in affirming the existence of any such object
it is consequently a mere product of the mind alone
of all the cosmological ideas however it is that occasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this step
for the existence of phenomena always conditioned and never selfsubsistent requires us to look for an object different from phenomenaan intelligible object with which all contingency must cease
but as we have allowed ourselves to assume the existence of a selfsubsistent reality out of the field of experience and are therefore obliged to regard phenomena as merely a contingent mode of representing intelligible objects employed by beings which are themselves intelligencesno other course remains for us than to follow analogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception of intelligible things of which we have not the least knowledge which nature taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions
experience made us acquainted with the contingent
but we are at present engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects of experience and must therefore deduce our knowledge of them from that which is necessary absolutely and in itself that is from pure conceptions
hence the first step which we take out of the world of sense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the investigation of a necessary being and to deduce from our conceptions of it all our conceptions of intelligible things
this we propose to attempt in the following chapter
chapter iii
the ideal of pure reason
section i
of the ideal in general
we have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind except under sensuous conditions because the conditions of objective reality do not exist in these conceptions which contain in fact nothing but the mere form of thought
they may however when applied to phenomena be presented in concreto for it is phenomena that present to them the materials for the formation of empirical conceptions which are nothing more than concrete forms of the conceptions of the understanding
but ideas are still further removed from objective reality than categories for no phenomenon can ever present them to the human mind in concreto
they contain a certain perfection attainable by no possible empirical cognition and they give to reason a systematic unity to which the unity of experience attempts to approximate but can never completely attain
but still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the ideal by which term i understand the idea not in concreto but in individuoas an individual thing determinable or determined by the idea alone
the idea of humanity in its complete perfection supposes not only the advancement of all the powers and faculties which constitute our conception of human nature to a complete attainment of their final aims but also everything which is requisite for the complete determination of the idea for of all contradictory predicates only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man
what i have termed an ideal was in platos philosophy an idea of the divine mindan individual object present to its pure intuition the most perfect of every kind of possible beings and the archetype of all phenomenal existences
without rising to these speculative heights we are bound to confess that human reason contains not only ideas but ideals which possess not like those of plato creative but certainly practical poweras regulative principles and form the basis of the perfectibility of certain actions
moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptions of reason because an empirical elementof pleasure or painlies at the foundation of them
in relation however to the principle whereby reason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law and consequently when we attend merely to their form they may be considered as pure conceptions of reason
virtue and wisdom in their perfect purity are ideas
but the wise man of the stoics is an ideal that is to say a human being existing only in thought and in complete conformity with the idea of wisdom
as the idea provides a rule so the ideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination of the copy
thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as a standard of action with which we may compare and judge ourselves which may help us to reform ourselves although the perfection it demands can never be attained by us
although we cannot concede objective reality to these ideals they are not to be considered as chimeras on the contrary they provide reason with a standard which enables it to estimate by comparison the degree of incompleteness in the objects presented to it
but to aim at realizing the ideal in an example in the world of experienceto describe for instance the character of the perfectly wise man in a romanceis impracticable
nay more there is something absurd in the attempt and the result must be little edifying as the natural limitations which are continually breaking in upon the perfection and completeness of the idea destroy the illusion in the story and throw an air of suspicion even on what is good in the idea which hence appears fictitious and unreal
such is the constitution of the ideal of reason which is always based upon determinate conceptions and serves as a rule and a model for limitation or of criticism
very different is the nature of the ideals of the imagination
of these it is impossible to present an intelligible conception they are a kind of monogram drawn according to no determinate rule and forming rather a vague picturethe production of many diverse experiencesthan a determinate image
such are the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have in their minds and which can serve neither as a model for production nor as a standard for appreciation
they may be termed though improperly sensuous ideals as they are declared to be models of certain possible empirical intuitions
they cannot however furnish rules or standards for explanation or examination
in its ideals reason aims at complete and perfect determination according to priori rules and hence it cogitates an object which must be completely determinable in conformity with principles although all empirical conditions are absent and the conception of the object is on this account transcendent
section ii
of the transcendental ideal prototypon trancendentale
every conception is in relation to that which is not contained in it undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability
this principle is that of every two contradictorily opposed predicates only one can belong to a conception
it is a purely logical principle itself based upon the principle of contradiction inasmuch as it makes complete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logical form of the cognition
but again everything as regards its possibility is also subject to the principle of complete determination according to which one of all the possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it
this principle is not based merely upon that of contradiction for in addition to the relation between two contradictory predicates it regards everything as standing in a relation to the sum of possibilities as the sum total of all predicates of things and while presupposing this sum as an priori condition presents to the mind everything as receiving the possibility of its individual existence from the relation it bears to and the share it possesses in the aforesaid sum of possibilities
the principle of complete determination relates the content and not to the logical form
it is the principle of the synthesis of all the predicates which are required to constitute the complete conception of a thing and not a mere principle analytical representation which enounces that one of two contradictory predicates must belong to a conception
it contains moreover a transcendental presuppositionthat namely of the material for all possibility which must contain priori the data for this or that particular possibility
thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to a common correlatethe sumtotal of possibility which if discovered to exist in the idea of one individual thing would establish the affinity of all possible things from the identity of the ground of their complete determination
the determinability of every conception is subordinate to the universality allgemeinheit universalitas of the principle of excluded middle the determination of a thing to the totality allheit universitas of all possible predicates
the proposition everything which exists is completely determined means not only that one of every pair of given contradictory attributes but that one of all possible attributes is always predicable of the thing in it the predicates are not merely compared logically with each other but the thing itself is transcendentally compared with the sumtotal of all possible predicates
the proposition is equivalent to saying to attain to a complete knowledge of a thing it is necessary to possess a knowledge of everything that is possible and to determine it thereby in a positive or negative manner
the conception of complete determination is consequently a conception which cannot be presented in its totality in concreto and is therefore based upon an idea which has its seat in the reasonthe faculty which prescribes to the understanding the laws of its harmonious and perfect exercise
now although this idea of the sumtotal of all possibility in so far as it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything is itself undetermined in relation to the predicates which may constitute this sumtotal and we cogitate in it merely the sumtotal of all possible predicateswe nevertheless find upon closer examination that this idea as a primitive conception of the mind excludes a large number of predicatesthose deduced and those irreconcilable with others and that it is evolved as a conception completely determined priori
thus it becomes the conception of an individual object which is completely determined by and through the mere idea and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason
when we consider all possible predicates not merely logically but transcendentally that is to say with reference to the content which may be cogitated as existing in them priori we shall find that some indicate a being others merely a nonbeing
the logical negation expressed in the word not does not properly belong to a conception but only to the relation of one conception to another in a judgement and is consequently quite insufficient to present to the mind the content of a conception
the expression not mortal does not indicate that a nonbeing is cogitated in the object it does not concern the content at all
a transcendental negation on the contrary indicates nonbeing in itself and is opposed to transcendental affirmation the conception of which of itself expresses a being
hence this affirmation indicates a reality because in and through it objects are considered to be somethingto be things while the opposite negation on the other hand indicates a mere want or privation or absence and where such negations alone are attached to a representation the nonexistence of anything corresponding to the representation
now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined without cogitating at the same time the opposite affirmation
the man born blind has not the least notion of darkness because he has none of light the vagabond knows nothing of poverty because he has never known what it is to be in comfort the ignorant man has no conception of his ignorance because he has no conception of knowledge
all conceptions of negatives are accordingly derived or deduced conceptions and realities contain the data and so to speak the material or transcendental content of the possibility and complete determination of all things
the investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us much that is wonderful but the most important lesson we have received from them is the discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation to the universean ignorance the magnitude of which reason without the information thus derived could never have conceived
this discovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the determination of the aims of human reason
if therefore a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation of the complete determination of thingsa substratum which is to form the fund from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied this substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sumtotal of reality omnitudo realitatis
in this view negations are nothing but limitationsa term which could not with propriety be applied to them if the unlimited the all did not form the true basis of our conception
this conception of a sumtotal of reality is the conception of a thing in itself regarded as completely determined and the conception of an ens realissimum is the conception of an individual being inasmuch as it is determined by that predicate of all possible contradictory predicates which indicates and belongs to being
it is therefore a transcendental ideal which forms the basis of the complete determination of everything that exists and is the highest material condition of its possibilitya condition on which must rest the cogitation of all objects with respect to their content
nay more this ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable because in this case alone a general conception of a thing is completely determined by and through itself and cognized as the representation of an individuum
the logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctive syllogism the major of which contains the logical division of the extent of a general conception the minor limits this extent to a certain part while the conclusion determines the conception by this part
the general conception of a reality cannot be divided priori because without the aid of experience we cannot know any determinate kinds of reality standing under the former as the genus
the transcendental principle of the complete determination of all things is therefore merely the representation of the sumtotal of all reality it is not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself but one which comprehends them all within itself
the complete determination of a thing is consequently based upon the limitation of this total of reality so much being predicated of the thing while all that remains over is excludeda procedure which is in exact agreement with that of the disjunctive syllogism and the determination of the objects in the conclusion by one of the members of the division
it follows that reason in laying the transcendental ideal at the foundation of its determination of all possible things takes a course in exact analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogismsa proposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of all transcendental ideas according to which they are produced in complete parallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed by the human mind
it is selfevident that reason in cogitating the necessary complete determination of things does not presuppose the existence of a being corresponding to its ideal but merely the idea of the idealfor the purpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of complete determination the ideal is therefore the prototype of all things which as defective copies ectypa receive from it the material of their possibility and approximate to it more or less though it is impossible that they can ever attain to its perfection
the possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derivedexcept that of the thing which contains in itself all reality which must be considered to be primitive and original
for all negationsand they are the only predicates by means of which all other things can be distinguished from the ens realissimumare mere limitations of a greater and a highernay the highest reality and they consequently presuppose this reality and are as regards their content derived from it
the manifold nature of things is only an infinitely various mode of limiting the conception of the highest reality which is their common substratum just as all figures are possible only as different modes of limiting infinite space
the object of the ideal of reasonan object existing only in reason itselfis also termed the primal being ens originarium as having no existence superior to him the supreme being ens summum and as being the condition of all other beings which rank under it the being of all beings ens entium
but none of these terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existing object to other things but merely that of an idea to conceptions and all our investigations into this subject still leave us in perfect uncertainty with regard to the existence of this being
a primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an existence which is derivative for the latter presuppose the former and therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it
it follows that the ideal of the primal being must be cogitated as simple
the deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primal being cannot strictly speaking be considered as a limitation or as a kind of division of its reality for this would be regarding the primal being as a mere aggregatewhich has been shown to be impossible although it was so represented in our first rough sketch
the highest reality must be regarded rather as the ground than as the sumtotal of the possibility of all things and the manifold nature of things be based not upon the limitation of the primal being itself but upon the complete series of effects which flow from it
and thus all our powers of sense as well as all phenomenal reality may be with propriety regarded as belonging to this series of effects while they could not have formed parts of the idea considered as an aggregate
pursuing this track and hypostatizing this idea we shall find ourselves authorized to determine our notion of the supreme being by means of the mere conception of a highest reality as one simple allsufficient eternal and so onin one word to determine it in its unconditioned completeness by the aid of every possible predicate
the conception of such a being is the conception of god in its transcendental sense and thus the ideal of pure reason is the objectmatter of a transcendental theology
but by such an employment of the transcendental idea we should be over stepping the limits of its validity and purpose
for reason placed it as the conception of all reality at the basis of the complete determination of things without requiring that this conception be regarded as the conception of an objective existence
such an existence would be purely fictitious and the hypostatizing of the content of the idea into an ideal as an individual being is a step perfectly unauthorized
nay more we are not even called upon to assume the possibility of such an hypothesis as none of the deductions drawn from such an ideal would affect the complete determination of things in generalfor the sake of which alone is the idea necessary
it is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic of reason we must also endeavour to discover the sources of this dialectic that we may have it in our power to give a rational explanation of this illusion as a phenomenon of the human mind
for the ideal of which we are at present speaking is based not upon an arbitrary but upon a natural idea
the question hence arises how happens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deduced from a single possibility that to wit of the highest reality and presupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being
the answer is ready it is at once presented by the procedure of transcendental analytic
the possibility of sensuous objects is a relation of these objects to thought in which something the empirical form may be cogitated priori while that which constitutes the matterthe reality of the phenomenon that element which corresponds to sensationmust be given from without as otherwise it could not even be cogitated by nor could its possibility be presentable to the mind
now a sensuous object is completely determined when it has been compared with all phenomenal predicates and represented by means of these either positively or negatively
but as that which constitutes the thing itselfthe real in a phenomenon must be given and that in which the real of all phenomena is given is experience one sole and allembracingthe material of the possibility of all sensuous objects must be presupposed as given in a whole and it is upon the limitation of this whole that the possibility of all empirical objects their distinction from each other and their complete determination are based
now no other objects are presented to us besides sensuous objects and these can be given only in connection with a possible experience it follows that a thing is not an object to us unless it presupposes the whole or sumtotal of empirical reality as the condition of its possibility
now a natural illusion leads us to consider this principle which is valid only of sensuous objects as valid with regard to things in general
and thus we are induced to hold the empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility of things as phenomena by leaving out this limitative condition to be a transcendental principle of the possibility of things in general
we proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sumtotal of all reality by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exercise of the understanding into the collective unity of an empirical wholea dialectical illusion and by cogitating this whole or sum of experience as an individual thing containing in itself all empirical reality
this individual thing or being is then by means of the abovementioned transcendental subreption substituted for our notion of a thing which stands at the head of the possibility of all things the real conditions of whose complete determination it presents
this ideal of the ens realissimumalthough merely a mental representationis first objectivized that is has an objective existence attributed to it then hypostatized and finally by the natural progress of reason to the completion of unity personified as we shall show presently
for the regulative unity of experience is not based upon phenomena themselves but upon the connection of the variety of phenomena by the understanding in a consciousness and thus the unity of the supreme reality and the complete determinability of all things seem to reside in a supreme understanding and consequently in a conscious intelligence
section iii
of the arguments employed by speculative reason in proof of the existence of a supreme being
notwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels to form some presupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis for the complete determination of its conceptions the idealistic and factitious nature of such a presupposition is too evident to allow reason for a moment to persuade itself into a belief of the objective existence of a mere creation of its own thought
but there are other considerations which compel reason to seek out some resting place in the regress from the conditioned to the unconditioned which is not given as an actual existence from the mere conception of it although it alone can give completeness to the series of conditions
and this is the natural course of every human reason even of the most uneducated although the path at first entered it does not always continue to follow
it does not begin from conceptions but from common experience and requires a basis in actual existence
but this basis is insecure unless it rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary
and this foundation is itself unworthy of trust if it leave under and above it empty space if it do not fill all and leave no room for a why or a wherefore if it be not in one word infinite in its reality
if we admit the existence of some one thing whatever it may be we must also admit that there is something which exists necessarily
for what is contingent exists only under the condition of some other thing which is its cause and from this we must go on to conclude the existence of a cause which is not contingent and which consequently exists necessarily and unconditionally
such is the argument by which reason justifies its advances towards a primal being
now reason looks round for the conception of a being that may be admitted without inconsistency to be worthy of the attribute of absolute necessity not for the purpose of inferring priori from the conception of such a being its objective existence for if reason allowed itself to take this course it would not require a basis in given and actual existence but merely the support of pure conceptions but for the purpose of discovering among all our conceptions of possible things that conception which possesses no element inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity
for that there must be some absolutely necessary existence it regards as a truth already established
now if it can remove every existence incapable of supporting the attribute of absolute necessity excepting onethis must be the absolutely necessary being whether its necessity is comprehensible by us that is deducible from the conception of it alone or not
now that the conception of which contains a therefore to every wherefore which is not defective in any respect whatever which is allsufficient as a condition seems to be the being of which we can justly predicate absolute necessityfor this reason that possessing the conditions of all that is possible it does not and cannot itself require any condition
and thus it satisfies in one respect at least the requirements of the conception of absolute necessity
in this view it is superior to all other conceptions which as deficient and incomplete do not possess the characteristic of independence of all higher conditions
it is true that we cannot infer from this that what does not contain in itself the supreme and complete conditionthe condition of all other thingsmust possess only a conditioned existence but as little can we assert the contrary for this supposed being does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reason to cognize by means of an priori conception the unconditioned and necessary nature of its existence
the conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the conception of an unconditioned and necessary being
the former conception does not satisfy all the requirements of the latter but we have no choice we are obliged to adhere to it for we find that we cannot do without the existence of a necessary being and even although we admit it we find it out of our power to discover in the whole sphere of possibility any being that can advance wellgrounded claims to such a distinction
the following is therefore the natural course of human reason
it begins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being
in this being it recognizes the characteristics of unconditioned existence
it then seeks the conception of that which is independent of all conditions and finds it in that which is itself the sufficient condition of all other thingsin other words in that which contains all reality
but the unlimited all is an absolute unity and is conceived by the mind as a being one and supreme and thus reason concludes that the supreme being as the primal basis of all things possesses an existence which is absolutely necessary
this conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory if we admit the existence of a necessary being and consider that there exists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions
in such a case we cannot make a better choice or rather we have no choice at all but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the absolute unity of complete reality as the highest source of the possibility of things
but if there exists no motive for coming to a definite conclusion and we may leave the question unanswered till we have fully weighed both sidesin other words when we are merely called upon to decide how much we happen to know about the question and how much we merely flatter ourselves that we knowthe above conclusion does not appear to be so great advantage but on the contrary seems defective in the grounds upon which it is supported
for admitting the truth of all that has been said that namely the inference from a given existence my own for example to the existence of an unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable that in the second place we must consider a being which contains all reality and consequently all the conditions of other things to be absolutely unconditioned and admitting too that we have thus discovered the conception of a thing to which may be attributed without inconsistency absolute necessityit does not follow from all this that the conception of a limited being in which the supreme reality does not reside is therefore incompatible with the idea of absolute necessity
for although i do not discover the element of the unconditioned in the conception of such a beingan element which is manifestly existent in the sumtotal of all conditionsi am not entitled to conclude that its existence is therefore conditioned just as i am not entitled to affirm in a hypothetical syllogism that where a certain condition does not exist in the present completeness as far as pure conceptions are concerned the conditioned does not exist either
on the contrary we are free to consider all limited beings as likewise unconditionally necessary although we are unable to infer this from the general conception which we have of them
thus conducted this argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of the properties of a necessary being and must be in every respect without result
this argument continues however to possess a weight and an authority which in spite of its objective insufficiency it has never been divested of
for granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us which as based on the ideas of reason deserve to be respected and submitted to although they are incapable of a real or practical application to our nature or in other words would be responsibilities without motives except upon the supposition of a supreme being to give effect and influence to the practical laws in such a case we should be bound to obey our conceptions which although objectively insufficient do according to the standard of reason preponderate over and are superior to any claims that may be advanced from any other quarter
the equilibrium of doubt would in this case be destroyed by a practical addition indeed reason would be compelled to condemn herself if she refused to comply with the demands of the judgement no superior to which we knowhowever defective her understanding of the grounds of these demands might be
this argument although in fact transcendental inasmuch as it rests upon the intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent is so simple and natural that the commonest understanding can appreciate its value
we see things around us change arise and pass away they or their condition must therefore have a cause
the same demand must again be made of the cause itselfas a datum of experience
now it is natural that we should place the highest causality just where we place supreme causality in that being which contains the conditions of all possible effects and the conception of which is so simple as that of an allembracing reality
this highest cause then we regard as absolutely necessary because we find it absolutely necessary to rise to it and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it
thus among all nations through the darkest polytheism glimmer some faint sparks of monotheism to which these idolaters have been led not from reflection and profound thought but by the study and natural progress of the common understanding
there are only three modes of proving the existence of a deity on the grounds of speculative reason
all the paths conducting to this end begin either from determinate experience and the peculiar constitution of the world of sense and rise according to the laws of causality from it to the highest cause existing apart from the worldor from a purely indeterminate experience that is some empirical existenceor abstraction is made of all experience and the existence of a supreme cause is concluded from priori conceptions alone
the first is the physicotheological argument the second the cosmological the third the ontological
more there are not and more there cannot be
i shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one paththe empiricalas on the otherthe transcendental and that it stretches its wings in vain to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculative thought
as regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments it will be exactly the reverse of that in which reason in the progress of its development attains to themthe order in which they are placed above
for it will be made manifest to the reader that although experience presents the occasion and the startingpoint it is the transcendental idea of reason which guides it in its pilgrimage and is the goal of all its struggles
i shall therefore begin with an examination of the transcendental argument and afterwards inquire what additional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the addition of the empirical element
section iv
of the impossibility of an ontological proof of the existence of god
it is evident from what has been said that the conception of an absolutely necessary being is a mere idea the objective reality of which is far from being established by the mere fact that it is a need of reason
on the contrary this idea serves merely to indicate a certain unattainable perfection and rather limits the operations than by the presentation of new objects extends the sphere of the understanding
but a strange anomaly meets us at the very threshold for the inference from a given existence in general to an absolutely necessary existence seems to be correct and unavoidable while the conditions of the understanding refuse to aid us in forming any conception of such a being
philosophers have always talked of an absolutely necessary being and have nevertheless declined to take the trouble of conceiving whetherand howa being of this nature is even cogitable not to mention that its existence is actually demonstrable
a verbal definition of the conception is certainly easy enough it is something the nonexistence of which is impossible
but does this definition throw any light upon the conditions which render it impossible to cogitate the nonexistence of a thingconditions which we wish to ascertain that we may discover whether we think anything in the conception of such a being or not for the mere fact that i throw away by means of the word unconditioned all the conditions which the understanding habitually requires in order to regard anything as necessary is very far from making clear whether by means of the conception of the unconditionally necessary i think of something or really of nothing at all
nay more this chanceconception now become so current many have endeavoured to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiries regarding its intelligibility quite needless
every geometrical propositiona triangle has three anglesit was said is absolutely necessary and thus people talked of an object which lay out of the sphere of our understanding as if it were perfectly plain what the conception of such a being meant
all the examples adduced have been drawn without exception from judgements and not from things
but the unconditioned necessity of a judgement does not form the absolute necessity of a thing
on the contrary the absolute necessity of a judgement is only a conditioned necessity of a thing or of the predicate in a judgement
the proposition abovementioned does not enounce that three angles necessarily exist but upon condition that a triangle exists three angles must necessarily existin it
and thus this logical necessity has been the source of the greatest delusions
having formed an priori conception of a thing the content of which was made to embrace existence we believed ourselves safe in concluding that because existence belongs necessarily to the object of the conception that is under the condition of my positing this thing as given the existence of the thing is also posited necessarily and that it is therefore absolutely necessarymerely because its existence has been cogitated in the conception
if in an identical judgement i annihilate the predicate in thought and retain the subject a contradiction is the result and hence i say the former belongs necessarily to the latter
but if i suppress both subject and predicate in thought no contradiction arises for there is nothing at all and therefore no means of forming a contradiction
to suppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles is selfcontradictory but to suppose the nonexistence of both triangle and angles is perfectly admissible
and so is it with the conception of an absolutely necessary being
annihilate its existence in thought and you annihilate the thing itself with all its predicates how then can there be any room for contradiction externally there is nothing to give rise to a contradiction for a thing cannot be necessary externally nor internally for by the annihilation or suppression of the thing itself its internal properties are also annihilated
god is omnipotentthat is a necessary judgement
his omnipotence cannot be denied if the existence of a deity is positedthe existence that is of an infinite being the two conceptions being identical
but when you say god does not exist neither omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed they must all disappear with the subject and in this judgement there cannot exist the least selfcontradiction
you have thus seen that when the predicate of a judgement is annihilated in thought along with the subject no internal contradiction can arise be the predicate what it may
there is no possibility of evading the conclusionyou find yourselves compelled to declare there are certain subjects which cannot be annihilated in thought
but this is nothing more than saying there exist subjects which are absolutely necessarythe very hypothesis which you are called upon to establish
for i find myself unable to form the slightest conception of a thing which when annihilated in thought with all its predicates leaves behind a contradiction and contradiction is the only criterion of impossibility in the sphere of pure priori conceptions
against these general considerations the justice of which no one can dispute one argument is adduced which is regarded as furnishing a satisfactory demonstration from the fact
it is affirmed that there is one and only one conception in which the nonbeing or annihilation of the object is selfcontradictory and this is the conception of an ens realissimum
it possesses you say all reality and you feel yourselves justified in admitting the possibility of such a being
this i am willing to grant for the present although the existence of a conception which is not selfcontradictory is far from being sufficient to prove the possibility of an object
now the notion of all reality embraces in it that of existence the notion of existence lies therefore in the conception of this possible thing
if this thing is annihilated in thought the internal possibility of the thing is also annihilated which is selfcontradictory
a conception is always possible if it is not selfcontradictory
this is the logical criterion of possibility distinguishing the object of such a conception from the nihil negativum
but it may be notwithstanding an empty conception unless the objective reality of this synthesis but which it is generated is demonstrated and a proof of this kind must be based upon principles of possible experience and not upon the principle of analysis or contradiction
this remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding from the possibility of a conceptionwhich is logicalthe possibility of a thingwhich is real
i answer it is absurd to introduceunder whatever term disguisedinto the conception of a thing which is to be cogitated solely in reference to its possibility the conception of its existence
if this is admitted you will have apparently gained the day but in reality have enounced nothing but a mere tautology
i ask is the proposition this or that thing which i am admitting to be possible exists an analytical or a synthetical proposition if the former there is no addition made to the subject of your thought by the affirmation of its existence but then the conception in your minds is identical with the thing itself or you have supposed the existence of a thing to be possible and then inferred its existence from its internal possibilitywhich is but a miserable tautology
the word reality in the conception of the thing and the word existence in the conception of the predicate will not help you out of the difficulty
for supposing you were to term all positing of a thing reality you have thereby posited the thing with all its predicates in the conception of the subject and assumed its actual existence and this you merely repeat in the predicate
but if you confess as every reasonable person must that every existential proposition is synthetical how can it be maintained that the predicate of existence cannot be denied without contradictiona property which is the characteristic of analytical propositions alone
i should have a reasonable hope of putting an end for ever to this sophistical mode of argumentation by a strict definition of the conception of existence did not my own experience teach me that the illusion arising from our confounding a logical with a real predicate a predicate which aids in the determination of a thing resists almost all the endeavours of explanation and illustration
a logical predicate may be what you please even the subject may be predicated of itself for logic pays no regard to the content of a judgement
but the determination of a conception is a predicate which adds to and enlarges the conception
it must not therefore be contained in the conception
being is evidently not a real predicate that is a conception of something which is added to the conception of some other thing
it is merely the positing of a thing or of certain determinations in it
logically it is merely the copula of a judgement
the proposition god is omnipotent contains two conceptions which have a certain object or content the word is is no additional predicateit merely indicates the relation of the predicate to the subject
now if i take the subject god with all its predicates omnipotence being one and say god is or there is a god i add no new predicate to the conception of god i merely posit or affirm the existence of the subject with all its predicatesi posit the object in relation to my conception
the content of both is the same and there is no addition made to the conception which expresses merely the possibility of the object by my cogitating the objectin the expression it isas absolutely given or existing
thus the real contains no more than the possible
a hundred real dollars contain no more than a hundred possible dollars
for as the latter indicate the conception and the former the object on the supposition that the content of the former was greater than that of the latter my conception would not be an expression of the whole object and would consequently be an inadequate conception of it
but in reckoning my wealth there may be said to be more in a hundred real dollars than in a hundred possible dollarsthat is in the mere conception of them
for the real objectthe dollarsis not analytically contained in my conception but forms a synthetical addition to my conception which is merely a determination of my mental state although this objective realitythis existenceapart from my conceptions does not in the least degree increase the aforesaid hundred dollars
by whatever and by whatever number of predicateseven to the complete determination of iti may cogitate a thing i do not in the least augment the object of my conception by the addition of the statement this thing exists
otherwise not exactly the same but something more than what was cogitated in my conception would exist and i could not affirm that the exact object of my conception had real existence
if i cogitate a thing as containing all modes of reality except one the mode of reality which is absent is not added to the conception of the thing by the affirmation that the thing exists on the contrary the thing existsif it exist at allwith the same defect as that cogitated in its conception otherwise not that which was cogitated but something different exists
now if i cogitate a being as the highest reality without defect or imperfection the question still remainswhether this being exists or not for although no element is wanting in the possible real content of my conception there is a defect in its relation to my mental state that is i am ignorant whether the cognition of the object indicated by the conception is possible posteriori
and here the cause of the present difficulty becomes apparent
if the question regarded an object of sense merely it would be impossible for me to confound the conception with the existence of a thing
for the conception merely enables me to cogitate an object as according with the general conditions of experience while the existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained in the sphere of actual experience
at the same time this connection with the world of experience does not in the least augment the conception although a possible perception has been added to the experience of the mind
but if we cogitate existence by the pure category alone it is not to be wondered at that we should find ourselves unable to present any criterion sufficient to distinguish it from mere possibility
whatever be the content of our conception of an object it is necessary to go beyond it if we wish to predicate existence of the object
in the case of sensuous objects this is attained by their connection according to empirical laws with some one of my perceptions but there is no means of cognizing the existence of objects of pure thought because it must be cognized completely priori
but all our knowledge of existence be it immediately by perception or by inferences connecting some object with a perception belongs entirely to the sphere of experiencewhich is in perfect unity with itself and although an existence out of this sphere cannot be absolutely declared to be impossible it is a hypothesis the truth of which we have no means of ascertaining
the notion of a supreme being is in many respects a highly useful idea but for the very reason that it is an idea it is incapable of enlarging our cognition with regard to the existence of things
it is not even sufficient to instruct us as to the possibility of a being which we do not know to exist
the analytical criterion of possibility which consists in the absence of contradiction in propositions cannot be denied it
but the connection of real properties in a thing is a synthesis of the possibility of which an priori judgement cannot be formed because these realities are not presented to us specifically and even if this were to happen a judgement would still be impossible because the criterion of the possibility of synthetical cognitions must be sought for in the world of experience to which the object of an idea cannot belong
and thus the celebrated leibnitz has utterly failed in his attempt to establish upon priori grounds the possibility of this sublime ideal being
the celebrated ontological or cartesian argument for the existence of a supreme being is therefore insufficient and we may as well hope to increase our stock of knowledge by the aid of mere ideas as the merchant to augment his wealth by the addition of noughts to his cash account
section v
of the impossibility of a cosmological proof of the existence of god
it was by no means a natural course of proceeding but on the contrary an invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools to attempt to draw from a mere idea a proof of the existence of an object corresponding to it
such a course would never have been pursued were it not for that need of reason which requires it to suppose the existence of a necessary being as a basis for the empirical regress and that as this necessity must be unconditioned and priori reason is bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy if possible this requirement and enable us to attain to the priori cognition of such a being
this conception was thought to be found in the idea of an ens realissimum and thus this idea was employed for the attainment of a better defined knowledge of a necessary being of the existence of which we were convinced or persuaded on other grounds
thus reason was seduced from her natural courage and instead of concluding with the conception of an ens realissimum an attempt was made to begin with it for the purpose of inferring from it that idea of a necessary existence which it was in fact called in to complete
thus arose that unfortunate ontological argument which neither satisfies the healthy common sense of humanity nor sustains the scientific examination of the philosopher
the cosmological proof which we are about to examine retains the connection between absolute necessity and the highest reality but instead of reasoning from this highest reality to a necessary existence like the preceding argument it concludes from the given unconditioned necessity of some being its unlimited reality
the track it pursues whether rational or sophistical is at least natural and not only goes far to persuade the common understanding but shows itself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect while it contains at the same time the outlines of all the arguments employed in natural theologyarguments which always have been and still will be in use and authority
these however adorned and hid under whatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment are at bottom identical with the arguments we are at present to discuss
this proof termed by leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi i shall now lay before the reader and subject to a strict examination
it is framed in the following manner if something exists an absolutely necessary being must likewise exist
now i at least exist
consequently there exists an absolutely necessary being
the minor contains an experience the major reasons from a general experience to the existence of a necessary being
thus this argument really begins at experience and is not completely priori or ontological
the object of all possible experience being the world it is called the cosmological proof
it contains no reference to any peculiar property of sensuous objects by which this world of sense might be distinguished from other possible worlds and in this respect it differs from the physicotheological proof which is based upon the consideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world
this inference is too well known to require more detailed discussion
it is based upon the spurious transcendental law of causality that everything which is contingent has a cause which if itself contingent must also have a cause and so on till the series of subordinated causes must end with an absolutely necessary cause without which it would not possess completeness
the proof proceeds thus a necessary being can be determined only in one way that is it can be determined by only one of all possible opposed predicates consequently it must be completely determined in and by its conception
but there is only a single conception of a thing possible which completely determines the thing priori that is the conception of the ens realissimum
it follows that the conception of the ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we can cogitate a necessary being
consequently a supreme being necessarily exists
in this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical propositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all her dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the most extreme character
we shall postpone an investigation of this argument for the present and confine ourselves to exposing the stratagem by which it imposes upon us an old argument in a new dress and appeals to the agreement of two witnesses the one with the credentials of pure reason and the other with those of empiricism while in fact it is only the former who has changed his dress and voice for the purpose of passing himself off for an additional witness
that it may possess a secure foundation it bases its conclusions upon experience and thus appears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument which places its confidence entirely in pure priori conceptions
but this experience merely aids reason in making one stepto the existence of a necessary being
what the properties of this being are cannot be learned from experience and therefore reason abandons it altogether and pursues its inquiries in the sphere of pure conception for the purpose of discovering what the properties of an absolutely necessary being ought to be that is what among all possible things contain the conditions requisita of absolute necessity
reason believes that it has discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens realissimumand in it alone and hence concludes the ens realissimum is an absolutely necessary being
but it is evident that reason has here presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectly adequate to the conception of a being of absolute necessity that is that we may infer the existence of the latter from that of the formera proposition which formed the basis of the ontological argument and which is now employed in the support of the cosmological argument contrary to the wish and professions of its inventors
for the existence of an absolutely necessary being is given in conceptions alone
but if i say the conception of the ens realissimum is a conception of this kind and in fact the only conception which is adequate to our idea of a necessary being i am obliged to admit that the latter may be inferred from the former
thus it is properly the ontological argument which figures in the cosmological and constitutes the whole strength of the latter while the spurious basis of experience has been of no further use than to conduct us to the conception of absolute necessity being utterly insufficient to demonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existence or thing
for when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character we must abandon the sphere of experience and rise to that of pure conceptions which we examine with the purpose of discovering whether any one contains the conditions of the possibility of an absolutely necessary being
but if the possibility of such a being is thus demonstrated its existence is also proved for we may then assert that of all possible beings there is one which possesses the attribute of necessityin other words this being possesses an absolutely necessary existence
all illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are presented in the formal manner employed by the schools which we now proceed to do
if the proposition every absolutely necessary being is likewise an ens realissimum is correct and it is this which constitutes the nervus probandi of the cosmological argument it must like all affirmative judgements be capable of conversionthe conversio per accidens at least
it follows then that some entia realissima are absolutely necessary beings
but no ens realissimum is in any respect different from another and what is valid of some is valid of all
in this present case therefore i may employ simple conversion and say every ens realissimum is a necessary being
but as this proposition is determined priori by the conceptions contained in it the mere conception of an ens realissimum must possess the additional attribute of absolute necessity
but this is exactly what was maintained in the ontological argument and not recognized by the cosmological although it formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning
thus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstrating the existence of a supreme being is not only like the first illusory and inadequate but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratio elenchiprofessing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal but bringing us back after a short circuit to the old path which we had deserted at its call
i mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect nest of dialectical assumptions which transcendental criticism does not find it difficult to expose and to dissipate
i shall merely enumerate these leaving it to the reader who must by this time be well practised in such matters to investigate the fallacies residing therein
the following fallacies for example are discoverable in this mode of proof
the transcendental principle everything that is contingent must have a causea principle without significance except in the sensuous world
for the purely intellectual conception of the contingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition like that of causality which is itself without significance or distinguishing characteristic except in the phenomenal world
but in the present case it is employed to help us beyond the limits of its sphere
from the impossibility of an infinite ascending series of causes in the world of sense a first cause is inferred a conclusion which the principles of the employment of reason do not justify even in the sphere of experience and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limits of this sphere
reason allows itself to be satisfied upon insufficient grounds with regard to the completion of this series
it removes all conditions without which however no conception of necessity can take place and as after this it is beyond our power to form any other conceptions it accepts this as a completion of the conception it wishes to form of the series
the logical possibility of a conception of the total of reality the criterion of this possibility being the absence of contradiction is confounded with the transcendental which requires a principle of the practicability of such a synthesisa principle which again refers us to the world of experience
and so on
the aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of proving the existence of a necessary being priori from mere conceptionsa proof which must be ontological and of which we feel ourselves quite incapable
with this purpose we reason from an actual existencean experience in general to an absolutely necessary condition of that existence
it is in this case unnecessary to demonstrate its possibility
for after having proved that it exists the question regarding its possibility is superfluous
now when we wish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being we do not look out for some being the conception of which would enable us to comprehend the necessity of its beingfor if we could do this an empirical presupposition would be unnecessary no we try to discover merely the negative condition conditio sine qua non without which a being would not be absolutely necessary
now this would be perfectly admissible in every sort of reasoning from a consequence to its principle but in the present case it unfortunately happens that the condition of absolute necessity can be discovered in but a single being the conception of which must consequently contain all that is requisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute necessity and thus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity priori
that is it must be possible to reason conversely and say the thing to which the conception of the highest reality belongs is absolutely necessary
but if i cannot reason thusand i cannot unless i believe in the sufficiency of the ontological argumenti find insurmountable obstacles in my new path and am really no farther than the point from which i set out
the conception of a supreme being satisfies all questions priori regarding the internal determinations of a thing and is for this reason an ideal without equal or parallel the general conception of it indicating it as at the same time an ens individuum among all possible things
but the conception does not satisfy the question regarding its existencewhich was the purpose of all our inquiries and although the existence of a necessary being were admitted we should find it impossible to answer the question what of all things in the world must be regarded as such
it is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an allsufficient beinga cause of all possible effectsfor the purpose of enabling reason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with regard to phenomena
but to assert that such a being necessarily exists is no longer the modest enunciation of an admissible hypothesis but the boldest declaration of an apodeictic certainty for the cognition of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possess that character
the aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to discover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute necessity or a conception which shall contain that idea
if the one is possible so is the other for reason recognizes that alone as absolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception
but both attempts are equally beyond our powerwe find it impossible to satisfy the understanding upon this point and as impossible to induce it to remain at rest in relation to this incapacity
unconditioned necessity which as the ultimate support and stay of all existing things is an indispensable requirement of the mind is an abyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay
even the idea of eternity terrible and sublime as it is as depicted by haller does not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe and terror for although it measures the duration of things it does not support them
we cannot bear nor can we rid ourselves of the thought that a being which we regard as the greatest of all possible existences should say to himself i am from eternity to eternity beside me there is nothing except that which exists by my will whence then am i here all sinks away from under us and the greatest as the smallest perfection hovers without stay or footing in presence of the speculative reason which finds it as easy to part with the one as with the other
many physical powers which evidence their existence by their effects are perfectly inscrutable in their nature they elude all our powers of observation
the transcendental object which forms the basis of phenomena and in connection with it the reason why our sensibility possesses this rather than that particular kind of conditions are and must ever remain hidden from our mental vision the fact is there the reason of the fact we cannot see
but an ideal of pure reason cannot be termed mysterious or inscrutable because the only credential of its reality is the need of it felt by reason for the purpose of giving completeness to the world of synthetical unity
an ideal is not even given as a cogitable object and therefore cannot be inscrutable on the contrary it must as a mere idea be based on the constitution of reason itself and on this account must be capable of explanation and solution
for the very essence of reason consists in its ability to give an account of all our conceptions opinions and assertionsupon objective or when they happen to be illusory and fallacious upon subjective grounds
detection and explanation of the dialectical illusion in all transcendental arguments for the existence of a necessary being
both of the above arguments are transcendental in other words they do not proceed upon empirical principles
for although the cosmological argument professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice of reasoning it did not ground its procedure upon the peculiar constitution of experience but upon pure principles of reasonin relation to an existence given by empirical consciousness utterly abandoning its guidance however for the purpose of supporting its assertions entirely upon pure conceptions
now what is the cause in these transcendental arguments of the dialectical but natural illusion which connects the conceptions of necessity and supreme reality and hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea what is the cause of this unavoidable step on the part of reason of admitting that some one among all existing things must be necessary while it falls back from the assertion of the existence of such a being as from an abyss and how does reason proceed to explain this anomaly to itself and from the wavering condition of a timid and reluctant approbationalways again withdrawnarrive at a calm and settled insight into its cause
it is something very remarkable that on the supposition that something exists i cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily
upon this perfectly naturalbut not on that account reliableinference does the cosmological argument rest
but let me form any conception whatever of a thing i find that i cannot cogitate the existence of the thing as absolutely necessary and that nothing prevents mebe the thing or being what it mayfrom cogitating its nonexistence
i may thus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessary basis while i cannot cogitate any single or individual thing as necessary
in other words i can never complete the regress through the conditions of existence without admitting the existence of a necessary being but on the other hand i cannot make a commencement from this being
if i must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis of existing things and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individual thing as in itself necessary the inevitable inference is that necessity and contingency are not properties of things themselvesotherwise an internal contradiction would result that consequently neither of these principles are objective but merely subjective principles of reasonthe one requiring us to seek for a necessary ground for everything that exists that is to be satisfied with no other explanation than that which is complete priori the other forbidding us ever to hope for the attainment of this completeness that is to regard no member of the empirical world as unconditioned
in this mode of viewing them both principles in their purely heuristic and regulative character and as concerning merely the formal interest of reason are quite consistent with each other
the one says you must philosophize upon nature as if there existed a necessary primal basis of all existing things solely for the purpose of introducing systematic unity into your knowledge by pursuing an idea of this charactera foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be ultimate while the other warns you to consider no individual determination concerning the existence of things as such an ultimate foundation that is as absolutely necessary but to keep the way always open for further progress in the deduction and to treat every determination as determined by some other
but if all that we perceive must be regarded as conditionally necessary it is impossible that anything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary
it follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary as out of and beyond the world inasmuch as it is useful only as a principle of the highest possible unity in experience and you cannot discover any such necessary existence in the would the second rule requiring you to regard all empirical causes of unity as themselves deduced
the philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as contingent while matter was considered by them in accordance with the judgement of the common reason of mankind as primal and necessary
but if they had regarded matter not relativelyas the substratum of phenomena but absolutely and in itselfas an independent existence this idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared
for there is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence on the contrary it can annihilate it in thought always and without selfcontradiction
but in thought alone lay the idea of absolute necessity
a regulative principle must therefore have been at the foundation of this opinion
in fact extension and impenetrabilitywhich together constitute our conception of matterform the supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena and this principle in so far as it is empirically unconditioned possesses the property of a regulative principle
but as every determination of matter which constitutes what is real in itand consequently impenetrabilityis an effect which must have a cause and is for this reason always derived the notion of matter cannot harmonize with the idea of a necessary being in its character of the principle of all derived unity
for every one of its real properties being derived must be only conditionally necessary and can therefore be annihilated in thought and thus the whole existence of matter can be so annihilated or suppressed
if this were not the case we should have found in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of unitywhich is impossible according to the second regulative principle
it follows that matter and in general all that forms part of the world of sense cannot be a necessary primal being nor even a principle of empirical unity but that this being or principle must have its place assigned without the world
and in this way we can proceed in perfect confidence to deduce the phenomena of the world and their existence from other phenomena just as if there existed no necessary being and we can at the same time strive without ceasing towards the attainment of completeness for our deduction just as if such a beingthe supreme condition of all existenceswere presupposed by the mind
these remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal of the supreme being far from being an enouncement of the existence of a being in itself necessary is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason requiring us to regard all connection existing between phenomena as if it had its origin from an allsufficient necessary cause and basing upon this the rule of a systematic and necessary unity in the explanation of phenomena
we cannot at the same time avoid regarding by a transcendental subreptio this formal principle as constitutive and hypostatizing this unity
precisely similar is the case with our notion of space
space is the primal condition of all forms which are properly just so many different limitations of it and thus although it is merely a principle of sensibility we cannot help regarding it as an absolutely necessary and selfsubsistent thingas an object given priori in itself
in the same way it is quite natural that as the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as a principle for the empirical employment of reason unless it is based upon the idea of an ens realissimum as the supreme cause we should regard this idea as a real object and this object in its character of supreme condition as absolutely necessary and that in this way a regulative should be transformed into a constitutive principle
this interchange becomes evident when i regard this supreme being which relatively to the world was absolutely unconditionally necessary as a thing per se
in this case i find it impossible to represent this necessity in or by any conception and it exists merely in my own mind as the formal condition of thought but not as a material and hypostatic condition of existence
section vi
of the impossibility of a physicotheological proof
if then neither a pure conception nor the general experience of an existing being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of the existence of the deity we can make the attempt by the only other modethat of grounding our argument upon a determinate experience of the phenomena of the present world their constitution and disposition and discover whether we can thus attain to a sound conviction of the existence of a supreme being
this argument we shall term the physicotheological argument
if it is shown to be insufficient speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of the existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea
it is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding sections that an answer to this question will be far from being difficult or unconvincing
for how can any experience be adequate with an idea the very essence of an idea consists in the fact that no experience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it
the transcendental idea of a necessary and allsufficient being is so immeasurably great so high above all that is empirical which is always conditioned that we hope in vain to find materials in the sphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception and in vain seek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned while examples nay even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical synthesis
if the supreme being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions it must be a member of the empirical series and like the lower members which it precedes have its origin in some higher member of the series
if on the other hand we disengage it from the chain and cogitate it as an intelligible being apart from the series of natural causeshow shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter from the former all laws respecting the regress from effects to causes all synthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possible experience and the objects of the sensuous world and apart from them are without significance
the world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle of order variety beauty and conformity to ends that whether we pursue our observations into the infinity of space in the one direction or into its illimitable divisions in the other whether we regard the world in its greatest or its least manifestationseven after we have attained to the highest summit of knowledge which our weak minds can reach we find that language in the presence of wonders so inconceivable has lost its force and number its power to reckon nay even thought fails to conceive adequately and our conception of the whole dissolves into an astonishment without power of expressionall the more eloquent that it is dumb
everywhere around us we observe a chain of causes and effects of means and ends of death and birth and as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which we find it we are constantly referred to some other thing which itself suggests the same inquiry regarding its cause and thus the universe must sink into the abyss of nothingness unless we admit that besides this infinite chain of contingencies there exists something that is primal and selfsubsistentsomething which as the cause of this phenomenal world secures its continuance and preservation
this highest causewhat magnitude shall we attribute to it of the content of the world we are ignorant still less can we estimate its magnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible
but this supreme cause being a necessity of the human mind what is there to prevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as to place it above the sphere of all that is possible this we can easily do although only by the aid of the faint outline of an abstract conception by representing this being to ourselves as containing in itself as an individual substance all possible perfectiona conception which satisfies that requirement of reason which demands parsimony in principles which is free from selfcontradiction which even contributes to the extension of the employment of reason in experience by means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order and system and which in no respect conflicts with any law of experience
this argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect
it is the oldest the clearest and that most in conformity with the common reason of humanity
it animates the study of nature as it itself derives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source
it introduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation could not of itself have discovered them and extends our knowledge of nature by directing our attention to a unity the principle of which lies beyond nature
this knowledge of nature again reacts upon this ideaits cause and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe rises to the power of an irresistible conviction
for these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this argument of the authority it has always enjoyed
the mind unceasingly elevated by these considerations which although empirical are so remarkably powerful and continually adding to their force will not suffer itself to be depressed by the doubts suggested by subtle speculation it tears itself out of this state of uncertainty the moment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature and the majesty of the universe and rises from height to height from condition to condition till it has elevated itself to the supreme and unconditioned author of all
but although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness and utility of this procedure but have rather to commend and encourage it we cannot approve of the claims which this argument advances to demonstrative certainty and to a reception upon its own merits apart from favour or support by other arguments
nor can it injure the cause of morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the arrogant sophist and to teach him that modesty and moderation which are the properties of a belief that brings calm and content into the mind without prescribing to it an unworthy subjection
i maintain then that the physicotheological argument is insufficient of itself to prove the existence of a supreme being that it must entrust this to the ontological argumentto which it serves merely as an introduction and that consequently this argument contains the only possible ground of proof possessed by speculative reason for the existence of this being
the chief momenta in the physicotheological argument are as follow
we observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of purpose executed with great wisdom and argument in whole of a content indescribably various and of an extent without limits
this arrangement of means and ends is entirely foreign to the things existing in the worldit belongs to them merely as a contingent attribute in other words the nature of different things could not of itself whatever means were employed harmoniously tend towards certain purposes were they not chosen and directed for these purposes by a rational and disposing principle in accordance with certain fundamental ideas
there exists therefore a sublime and wise cause or several which is not merely a blind allpowerful nature producing the beings and events which fill the world in unconscious fecundity but a free and intelligent cause of the world
the unity of this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relation existing between the parts of the world as portions of an artistic edificean inference which all our observation favours and all principles of analogy support
in the above argument it is inferred from the analogy of certain products of nature with those of human art when it compels nature to bend herself to its purposes as in the case of a house a ship or a watch that the same kind of causalitynamely understanding and willresides in nature
it is also declared that the internal possibility of this freelyacting nature which is the source of all art and perhaps also of human reason is derivable from another and superhuman arta conclusion which would perhaps be found incapable of standing the test of subtle transcendental criticism
but to neither of these opinions shall we at present object
we shall only remark that it must be confessed that if we are to discuss the subject of cause at all we cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of the analogy subsisting between nature and such products of designthese being the only products whose causes and modes of organization are completely known to us
reason would be unable to satisfy her own requirements if she passed from a causality which she does know to obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does not know
according to the physicotheological argument the connection and harmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form merely but not of the matter that is of the substance of the world
to establish the truth of the latter opinion it would be necessary to prove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmony and order unless they were even as regards their substance the product of a supreme wisdom
but this would require very different grounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art
this proof can at most therefore demonstrate the existence of an architect of the world whose efforts are limited by the capabilities of the material with which he works but not of a creator of the world to whom all things are subject
thus this argument is utterly insufficient for the task before usa demonstration of the existence of an allsufficient being
if we wish to prove the contingency of matter we must have recourse to a transcendental argument which the physicotheological was constructed expressly to avoid
we infer from the order and design visible in the universe as a disposition of a thoroughly contingent character the existence of a cause proportionate thereto
the conception of this cause must contain certain determinate qualities and it must therefore be regarded as the conception of a being which possesses all power wisdom and so on in one word all perfectionthe conception that is of an allsufficient being
for the predicates of very great astonishing or immeasurable power and excellence give us no determinate conception of the thing nor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself
they merely indicate the relation existing between the magnitude of the object and the observer who compares it with himself and with his own power of comprehension and are mere expressions of praise and reverence by which the object is either magnified or the observing subject depreciated in relation to the object
where we have to do with the magnitude of the perfection of a thing we can discover no determinate conception except that which comprehends all possible perfection or completeness and it is only the total omnitudo of reality which is completely determined in and through its conception alone
now it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declare that he has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude of the world he contemplates bears in its extent as well as in its content to omnipotence into that of the order and design in the world to the highest wisdom and that of the unity of the world to the absolute unity of a supreme being
physicotheology is therefore incapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause of the world and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theologya theology which is itself to be the basis of religion
the attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on the path of empiricism
and yet this is the path pursued in the physicotheological argument
what means shall we employ to bridge the abyss
after elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power wisdom and other attributes of the author of the world and finding we can advance no further we leave the argument on empirical grounds and proceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order and conformity to aims that are observable in it
from this contingency we infer by the help of transcendental conceptions alone the existence of something absolutely necessary and still advancing proceed from the conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to the completely determined or determining conception thereofthe conception of an allembracing reality
thus the physicotheological failing in its undertaking recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmological argument and as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise it executes its design solely by the aid of pure reason although it at first professed to have no connection with this faculty and to base its entire procedure upon experience alone
the physicotheologians have therefore no reason to regard with such contempt the transcendental mode of argument and to look down upon it with the conceit of clearsighted observers of nature as the braincobweb of obscure speculatists
for if they reflect upon and examine their own arguments they will find that after following for some time the path of nature and experience and discovering themselves no nearer their object they suddenly leave this path and pass into the region of pure possibility where they hope to reach upon the wings of ideas what had eluded all their empirical investigations
gaining as they think a firm footing after this immense leap they extend their determinate conceptioninto the possession of which they have come they know not howover the whole sphere of creation and explain their ideal which is entirely a product of pure reason by illustrations drawn from experiencethough in a degree miserably unworthy of the grandeur of the object while they refuse to acknowledge that they have arrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road from that of experience
thus the physicotheological is based upon the cosmological and this upon the ontological proof of the existence of a supreme being and as besides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason the ontological proof on the ground of pure conceptions of reason is the only possible one if any proof of a proposition so far transcending the empirical exercise of the understanding is possible at all
section vii
critique of all theology based upon speculative principles of reason
if by the term theology i understand the cognition of a primal being that cognition is based either upon reason alone theologia rationalis or upon revelation theologia revelata
the former cogitates its object either by means of pure transcendental conceptions as an ens originarium realissimum ens entium and is termed transcendental theology or by means of a conception derived from the nature of our own mind as a supreme intelligence and must then be entitled natural theology
the person who believes in a transcendental theology alone is termed a deist he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural theology also a theist
the former admits that we can cognize by pure reason alone the existence of a supreme being but at the same time maintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental and that all we can say of it is that it possesses all reality without being able to define it more closely
the second asserts that reason is capable of presenting us from the analogy with nature with a more definite conception of this being and that its operations as the cause of all things are the results of intelligence and free will
the former regards the supreme being as the cause of the worldwhether by the necessity of his nature or as a free agent is left undetermined the latter considers this being as the author of the world
transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a supreme being from a general experience without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs and in this case it is called cosmotheology or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being through mere conceptions without the aid of experience and is then termed ontotheology
natural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an author of the world from the constitution of the order and unity observable in the world in which two modes of causality must be admitted to existthose of nature and freedom
thus it rises from this world to a supreme intelligence either as the principle of all natural or of all moral order and perfection
in the former case it is termed physicotheology in the latter ethical or moraltheology
not theological ethics for this science contains ethical laws which presuppose the existence of a supreme governor of the world while moraltheology on the contrary is the expression of a conviction of the existence of a supreme being founded upon ethical laws
as we are wont to understand by the term god not merely an eternal nature the operations of which are insensate and blind but a supreme being who is the free and intelligent author of all things and as it is this latter view alone that can be of interest to humanity we might in strict rigour deny to the deist any belief in god at all and regard him merely as a maintainer of the existence of a primal being or thingthe supreme cause of all other things
but as no one ought to be blamed merely because he does not feel himself justified in maintaining a certain opinion as if he altogether denied its truth and asserted the opposite it is more correctas it is less harshto say the deist believes in a god the theist in a living god summa intelligentia
we shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all these attempts of reason to establish the existence of a supreme being
it may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or cognition as knowledge of that which is and practical knowledge as knowledge of that which ought to be
in this view the theoretical employment of reason is that by which i cognize priori as necessary that something is while the practical is that by which i cognize priori what ought to happen
now if it is an indubitably certain though at the same time an entirely conditioned truth that something is or ought to happen either a certain determinate condition of this truth is absolutely necessary or such a condition may be arbitrarily presupposed
in the former case the condition is postulated per thesin in the latter supposed per hypothesin
there are certain practical lawsthose of moralitywhich are absolutely necessary
now if these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being as the condition of the possibility of their obligatory power this being must be postulated because the conditioned from which we reason to this determinate condition is itself cognized priori as absolutely necessary
we shall at some future time show that the moral laws not merely presuppose the existence of a supreme being but also as themselves absolutely necessary in a different relation demand or postulate italthough only from a practical point of view
the discussion of this argument we postpone for the present
when the question relates merely to that which is not to that which ought to be the conditioned which is presented in experience is always cogitated as contingent
for this reason its condition cannot be regarded as absolutely necessary but merely as relatively necessary or rather as needful the condition is in itself and priori a mere arbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition by reason of the conditioned
if then we are to possess a theoretical cognition of the absolute necessity of a thing we cannot attain to this cognition otherwise than priori by means of conceptions while it is impossible in this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any relation to an existence given in experience
theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or certain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be discovered by means of experience
it is opposed to the cognition of nature which concerns only those objects or predicates which can be presented in a possible experience
the principle that everything which happens the empirically contingent must have a cause is a principle of the cognition of nature but not of speculative cognition
for if we change it into an abstract principle and deprive it of its reference to experience and the empirical we shall find that it cannot with justice be regarded any longer as a synthetical proposition and that it is impossible to discover any mode of transition from that which exists to something entirely differenttermed cause
nay more the conception of a cause likewise that of the contingentloses in this speculative mode of employing it all significance for its objective reality and meaning are comprehensible from experience alone
when from the existence of the universe and the things in it the existence of a cause of the universe is inferred reason is proceeding not in the natural but in the speculative method
for the principle of the former enounces not that things themselves or substances but only that which happens or their statesas empirically contingent have a cause the assertion that the existence of substance itself is contingent is not justified by experience it is the assertion of a reason employing its principles in a speculative manner
if again i infer from the form of the universe from the way in which all things are connected and act and react upon each other the existence of a cause entirely distinct from the universethis would again be a judgement of purely speculative reason because the object in this casethe causecan never be an object of possible experience
in both these cases the principle of causality which is valid only in the field of experienceuseless and even meaningless beyond this region would be diverted from its proper destination
now i maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by the aid of speculation alone are fruitless that the principles of reason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theological truths and consequently that a rational theology can have no existence unless it is founded upon the laws of morality
for all synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent in experience while the cognition of a supreme being necessitates their being employed transcendentally and of this the understanding is quite incapable
if the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to a supreme being this being must belong to the chain of empirical objectsin which case it would be like all phenomena itself conditioned
if the possibility of passing the limits of experience be admitted by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to its cause what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure certainly not the conception of a supreme being because experience never presents us with the greatest of all possible effects and it is only an effect of this character that could witness to the existence of a corresponding cause
if for the purpose of fully satisfying the requirements of reason we recognize her right to assert the existence of a perfect and absolutely necessary being this can be admitted only from favour and cannot be regarded as the result of irresistible demonstration
the physicotheological proof may add weight to othersif other proofs there areby connecting speculation with experience but in itself it rather prepares the mind for theological cognition and gives it a right and natural direction than establishes a sure foundation for theology
it is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of transcendental answersthose presented priori by pure conceptions without the least empirical admixture
but the question in the present case is evidently syntheticalit aims at the extension of our cognition beyond the bounds of experienceit requires an assurance respecting the existence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds to which no experience can ever be adequate
now it has been abundantly proved that all priori synthetical cognition is possible only as the expression of the formal conditions of a possible experience and that the validity of all principles depends upon their immanence in the field of experience that is their relation to objects of empirical cognition or phenomena
thus all transcendental procedure in reference to speculative theology is without result
if any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of our analytic to losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and time honoured arguments he at least cannot decline answering the questionhow he can pass the limits of all possible experience by the help of mere ideas
if he talks of new arguments or of improvements upon old arguments i request him to spare me
there is certainly no great choice in this sphere of discussion as all speculative arguments must at last look for support to the ontological and i have therefore very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of the dogmatical defenders of a nonsensuous reason
without looking upon myself as a remarkably combative person i shall not decline the challenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every attempt of speculative theology
and yet the hope of better fortune never deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode of procedure
i shall therefore restrict myself to the simple and equitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate from the nature of the human mind as well as from that of the other sources of knowledge how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely priori and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us and no means exist of guaranteeing the objective reality of our conceptions
in whatever way the understanding may have attained to a conception the existence of the object of the conception cannot be discovered in it by analysis because the cognition of the existence of the object depends upon the objects being posited and given in itself apart from the conception
but it is utterly impossible to go beyond our conception without the aid of experiencewhich presents to the mind nothing but phenomena or to attain by the help of mere conceptions to a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects or supernatural beings
but although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a supreme being it is of the highest utility in correcting our conception of this beingon the supposition that we can attain to the cognition of it by some other meansin making it consistent with itself and with all other conceptions of intelligible objects clearing it from all that is incompatible with the conception of an ens summun and eliminating from it all limitations or admixtures of empirical elements
transcendental theology is still therefore notwithstanding its objective insufficiency of importance in a negative respect it is useful as a test of the procedure of reason when engaged with pure ideas no other than a transcendental standard being in this case admissible
for if from a practical point of view the hypothesis of a supreme and allsufficient being is to maintain its validity without opposition it must be of the highest importance to define this conception in a correct and rigorous manneras the transcendental conception of a necessary being to eliminate all phenomenal elements anthropomorphism in its most extended signification and at the same time to overflow all contradictory assertionsbe they atheistic deistic or anthropomorphic
this is of course very easy as the same arguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm the existence of a supreme being must be alike sufficient to prove the invalidity of its denial
for it is impossible to gain from the pure speculation of reason demonstration that there exists no supreme being as the ground of all that exists or that this being possesses none of those properties which we regard as analogical with the dynamical qualities of a thinking being or that as the anthropomorphists would have us believe it is subject to all the limitations which sensibility imposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world of experience
a supreme being is therefore for the speculative reason a mere ideal though a faultless onea conception which perfects and crowns the system of human cognition but the objective reality of which can neither be proved nor disproved by pure reason
if this defect is ever supplied by a moral theology the problematic transcendental theology which has preceded will have been at least serviceable as demonstrating the mental necessity existing for the conception by the complete determination of it which it has furnished and the ceaseless testing of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense and not always in harmony with its own ideas
the attributes of necessity infinitude unity existence apart from the world and not as a world soul eternity free from conditions of time omnipresence free from conditions of space omnipotence and others are pure transcendental predicates and thus the accurate conception of a supreme being which every theology requires is furnished by transcendental theology alone
appendix
of the regulative employment of the ideas of pure reason
the result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not only confirms the truth of what we have already proved in our transcendental analytic namely that all inferences which would lead us beyond the limits of experience are fallacious and groundless but it at the same time teaches us this important lesson that human reason has a natural inclination to overstep these limits and that transcendental ideas are as much the natural property of the reason as categories are of the understanding
there exists this difference however that while the categories never mislead us outward objects being always in perfect harmony therewith ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions the severest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from the fallacies which they induce
whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in harmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers when once we have discovered their true direction and aim
we are entitled to suppose therefore that there exists a mode of employing transcendental ideas which is proper and immanent although when we mistake their meaning and regard them as conceptions of actual things their mode of application is transcendent and delusive
for it is not the idea itself but only the employment of the idea in relation to possible experience that is transcendent or immanent
an idea is employed transcendently when it is applied to an object falsely believed to be adequate with and to correspond to it imminently when it is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in the sphere of experience
thus all errors of subreptioof misapplication are to be ascribed to defects of judgement and not to understanding or reason
reason never has an immediate relation to an object it relates immediately to the understanding alone
it is only through the understanding that it can be employed in the field of experience
it does not form conceptions of objects it merely arranges them and gives to them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphere of their application has been extended as widely as possible
reason avails itself of the conception of the understanding for the sole purpose of producing totality in the different series
this totality the understanding does not concern itself with its only occupation is the connection of experiences by which series of conditions in accordance with conceptions are established
the object of reason is therefore the understanding and its proper destination
as the latter brings unity into the diversity of objects by means of its conceptions so the former brings unity into the diversity of conceptions by means of ideas as it sets the final aim of a collective unity to the operations of the understanding which without this occupies itself with a distributive unity alone
i accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed as constitutive ideas that they cannot be conceptions of objects and that when thus considered they assume a fallacious and dialectical character
but on the other hand they are capable of an admirable and indispensably necessary application to objectsas regulative ideas directing the understanding to a certain aim the guiding lines towards which all its laws follow and in which they all meet in one point
this pointthough a mere idea focus imaginarius that is not a point from which the conceptions of the understanding do really proceed for it lies beyond the sphere of possible experienceserves notwithstanding to give to these conceptions the greatest possible unity combined with the greatest possible extension
hence arises the natural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceed from an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it
but this illusionwhich we may hinder from imposing upon usis necessary and unavoidable if we desire to see not only those objects which lie before us but those which are at a great distance behind us that is to say when in the present case we direct the aims of the understanding beyond every given experience towards an extension as great as can possibly be attained
if we review our cognitions in their entire extent we shall find that the peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system that is to say to give them connection according to a principle
this unity presupposes an ideathe idea of the form of a whole of cognition preceding the determinate cognition of the parts and containing the conditions which determine priori to every part its place and relation to the other parts of the whole system
this idea accordingly demands complete unity in the cognition of the understandingnot the unity of a contingent aggregate but that of a system connected according to necessary laws
it cannot be affirmed with propriety that this idea is a conception of an object it is merely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of objects in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as a rule
such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature on the contrary we employ them for the interrogation and investigation of nature and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is not adequate to them
we admit that such a thing as pure earth pure water or pure air is not to be discovered
and yet we require these conceptions which have their origin in the reason so far as regards their absolute purity and completeness for the purpose of determining the share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon
thus the different kinds of matter are all referred to earths as mere weight to salts and inflammable bodies as pure force and finally to water and air as the vehicula of the former or the machines employed by them in their operationsfor the purpose of explaining the chemical action and reaction of bodies in accordance with the idea of a mechanism
for although not actually so expressed the influence of such ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of natural philosophers
if reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general and if the general be certain in se and given it is only necessary that the judgement should subsume the particular under the general the particular being thus necessarily determined
i shall term this the demonstrative or apodeictic employment of reason
if however the general is admitted as problematical only and is a mere idea the particular case is certain but the universality of the rule which applies to this particular case remains a problem
several particular cases the certainty of which is beyond doubt are then taken and examined for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicable to them and if it appears that all the particular cases which can be collected follow from the rule its universality is inferred and at the same time all the causes which have not or cannot be presented to our observation are concluded to be of the same character with those which we have observed
this i shall term the hypothetical employment of the reason
the hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as problematical conceptions is properly not constitutive
that is to say if we consider the subject strictly the truth of the rule which has been employed as an hypothesis does not follow from the use that is made of it by reason
for how can we know all the possible cases that may arise some of which may however prove exceptions to the universality of the rule
this employment of reason is merely regulative and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into the aggregate of our particular cognitions and thereby the approximating of the rule to universality
the object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the systematic unity of cognitions and this unity is the criterion of the truth of a rule
on the other hand this systematic unityas a mere ideais in fact merely a unity projected not to be regarded as given but only in the light of a problema problem which serves however as a principle for the various and particular exercise of the understanding in experience directs it with regard to those cases which are not presented to our observation and introduces harmony and consistency into all its operations
all that we can be certain of from the above considerations is that this systematic unity is a logical principle whose aim is to assist the understanding where it cannot of itself attain to rules by means of ideas to bring all these various rules under one principle and thus to ensure the most complete consistency and connection that can be attained
but the assertion that objects and the understanding by which they are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematic unity that this may be postulated priori without any reference to the interest of reason and that we are justified in declaring all possible cognitionsempirical and othersto possess systematic unity and to be subject to general principles from which notwithstanding their various character they are all derivable such an assertion can be founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason which would render this systematic unity not subjectively and logicallyin its character of a method but objectively necessary
we shall illustrate this by an example
the conceptions of the understanding make us acquainted among many other kinds of unity with that of the causality of a substance which is termed power
the different phenomenal manifestations of the same substance appear at first view to be so very dissimilar that we are inclined to assume the existence of just as many different powers as there are different effectsas in the case of the human mind we have feeling consciousness imagination memory wit analysis pleasure desire and so on
now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these differences to as small a number as possible by comparing them and discovering the hidden identity which exists
we must inquire for example whether or not imagination connected with consciousness memory wit and analysis are not merely different forms of understanding and reason
the idea of a fundamental power the existence of which no effort of logic can assure us of is the problem to be solved for the systematic representation of the existing variety of powers
the logical principle of reason requires us to produce as great a unity as is possible in the system of our cognitions and the more the phenomena of this and the other power are found to be identical the more probable does it become that they are nothing but different manifestations of one and the same power which may be called relatively speaking a fundamental power
and so with other cases
these relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each other to discover if possible the one radical and absolutely fundamental power of which they are but the manifestations
but this unity is purely hypothetical
it is not maintained that this unity does really exist but that we must in the interest of reason that is for the establishment of principles for the various rules presented by experience try to discover and introduce it so far as is practicable into the sphere of our cognitions
but the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us to believe that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical but that it possesses objective reality and thus the systematic unity of the various powers or forces in a substance is demanded by the understanding and erected into an apodeictic or necessary principle
for without having attempted to discover the unity of the various powers existing in nature nay even after all our attempts have failed we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist and may be sooner or later discovered
and this reason does not only as in the case above adduced with regard to the unity of substance but where many substances although all to a certain extent homogeneous are discoverable as in the case of matter in general
here also does reason presuppose the existence of the systematic unity of various powersinasmuch as particular laws of nature are subordinate to general laws and parsimony in principles is not merely an economical principle of reason but an essential law of nature
we cannot understand in fact how a logical principle of unity can of right exist unless we presuppose a transcendental principle by which such a systematic unitas a property of objects themselvesis regarded as necessary priori
for with what right can reason in its logical exercise require us to regard the variety of forces which nature displays as in effect a disguised unity and to deduce them from one fundamental force or power when she is free to admit that it is just as possible that all forces should be different in kind and that a systematic unity is not conformable to the design of nature in this view of the case reason would be proceeding in direct opposition to her own destination by setting as an aim an idea which entirely conflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature
neither can we assert that reason has previously inferred this unity from the contingent nature of phenomena
for the law of reason which requires us to seek for this unity is a necessary law inasmuch as without it we should not possess a faculty of reason nor without reason a consistent and selfaccordant mode of employing the understanding nor in the absence of this any proper and sufficient criterion of empirical truth
in relation to this criterion therefore we must suppose the idea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validity and necessity
we find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms in the principles of philosophers although they have neither recognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence
that the diversities of individual things do not exclude identity of species that the various species must be considered as merely different determinations of a few genera and these again as divisions of still higher races and so onthat accordingly a certain systematic unity of all possible empirical conceptions in so far as they can be deduced from higher and more general conceptions must be sought for is a scholastic maxim or logical principle without which reason could not be employed by us
for we can infer the particular from the general only in so far as general properties of things constitute the foundation upon which the particular rest
that the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in the wellknown scholastic maxim which forbids us unnecessarily to augment the number of entities or principles entia praeter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda
this maxim asserts that nature herself assists in the establishment of this unity of reason and that the seemingly infinite diversity of phenomena should not deter us from the expectation of discovering beneath this diversity a unity of fundamental properties of which the aforesaid variety is but a more or less determined form
this unity although a mere idea thinkers have found it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it
it was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce all salts to two main generaacids and alkalis and they regard this difference as itself a mere variety or different manifestation of one and the same fundamental material
the different kinds of earths stones and even metals chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three and afterwards to two but still not content with this advance they cannot but think that behind these diversities there lurks but one genusnay that even salts and earths have a common principle
it might be conjectured that this is merely an economical plan of reason for the purpose of sparing itself trouble and an attempt of a purely hypothetical character which when successful gives an appearance of probability to the principle of explanation employed by the reason
but a selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from the idea according to which every one presupposes that this unity is in accordance with the laws of nature and that reason does not in this case request but requires although we are quite unable to determine the proper limits of this unity
if the diversity existing in phenomenaa diversity not of form for in this they may be similar but of contentwere so great that the subtlest human reason could never by comparison discover in them the least similarity which is not impossible in this case the logical law of genera would be without foundation the conception of a genus nay all general conceptions would be impossible and the faculty of the understanding the exercise of which is restricted to the world of conceptions could not exist
the logical principle of genera accordingly if it is to be applied to nature by which i mean objects presented to our senses presupposes a transcendental principle
in accordance with this principle homogeneity is necessarily presupposed in the variety of phenomena although we are unable to determine priori the degree of this homogeneity because without it no empirical conceptions and consequently no experience would be possible
the logical principle of genera which demands identity in phenomena is balanced by another principlethat of species which requires variety and diversity in things notwithstanding their accordance in the same genus and directs the understanding to attend to the one no less than to the other
this principle of the faculty of distinction acts as a check upon the reason and reason exhibits in this respect a double and conflicting intereston the one hand the interest in the extent the interest of generality in relation to genera on the other that of the content the interest of individuality in relation to the variety of species
in the former case the understanding cogitates more under its conceptions in the latter it cogitates more in them
this distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits of thought peculiar to natural philosophers some of whomthe remarkably speculative headsmay be said to be hostile to heterogeneity in phenomena and have their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera while otherswith a strong empirical tendencyaim unceasingly at the analysis of phenomena and almost destroy in us the hope of ever being able to estimate the character of these according to general principles
the latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle the aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions
this principle authorizes me beginning at the genus to descend to the various and diverse contained under it and in this way extension as in the former case unity is assured to the system
for if we merely examine the sphere of the conception which indicates a genus we cannot discover how far it is possible to proceed in the division of that sphere just as it is impossible from the consideration of the space occupied by matter to determine how far we can proceed in the division of it
hence every genus must contain different species and these again different subspecies and as each of the latter must itself contain a sphere must be of a certain extent as a conceptus communis reason demands that no species or subspecies is to be considered as the lowest possible
for a species or subspecies being always a conception which contains only what is common to a number of different things does not completely determine any individual thing or relate immediately to it and must consequently contain other conceptions that is other subspecies under it
this law of specification may be thus expressed entium varietates non temere sunt minuendae
but it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be without sense or application were it not based upon a transcendental law of specification which certainly does not require that the differences existing phenomena should be infinite in number for the logical principle which merely maintains the indeterminateness of the logical sphere of a conception in relation to its possible division does not authorize this statement while it does impose upon the understanding the duty of searching for subspecies to every species and minor differences in every difference
for were there no lower conceptions neither could there be any higher
now the understanding cognizes only by means of conceptions consequently how far soever it may proceed in division never by mere intuition but always by lower and lower conceptions
the cognition of phenomena in their complete determination which is possible only by means of the understanding requires an unceasingly continued specification of conceptions and a progression to ever smaller differences of which abstraction had been made in the conception of the species and still more in that of the genus
this law of specification cannot be deduced from experience it can never present us with a principle of so universal an application
empirical specification very soon stops in its distinction of diversities and requires the guidance of the transcendental law as a principle of the reasona law which imposes on us the necessity of never ceasing in our search for differences even although these may not present themselves to the senses
that absorbent earths are of different kinds could only be discovered by obeying the anticipatory law of reason which imposes upon the understanding the task of discovering the differences existing between these earths and supposes that nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate
the faculty of the understanding belongs to us just as much under the presupposition of differences in the objects of nature as under the condition that these objects are homogeneous because we could not possess conceptions nor make any use of our understanding were not the phenomena included under these conceptions in some respects dissimilar as well as similar in their character
reason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operations of this faculty
by the principle of the homogeneity of the diverse in higher genera
by the principle of the variety of the homogeneous in lower species and to complete the systematic unity it adds
a law of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuous transition from one species to every other by the gradual increase of diversity
we may term these the principles of the homogeneity the specification and the continuity of forms
the latter results from the union of the two former inasmuch as we regard the systematic connection as complete in thought in the ascent to higher genera as well as in the descent to lower species
for all diversities must be related to each other as they all spring from one highest genus descending through the different gradations of a more and more extended determination
we may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical principles in the following manner
every conception may be regarded as a point which as the standpoint of a spectator has a certain horizon which may be said to enclose a number of things that may be viewed so to speak from that centre
within this horizon there must be an infinite number of other points each of which has its own horizon smaller and more circumscribed in other words every species contains subspecies according to the principle of specification and the logical horizon consists of smaller horizons subspecies but not of points individuals which possess no extent
but different horizons or genera which include under them so many conceptions may have one common horizon from which as from a midpoint they may be surveyed and we may proceed thus till we arrive at the highest genus or universal and true horizon which is determined by the highest conception and which contains under itself all differences and varieties as genera species and subspecies
to this highest standpoint i am conducted by the law of homogeneity as to all lower and more variouslydetermined conceptions by the law of specification
now as in this way there exists no void in the whole extent of all possible conceptions and as out of the sphere of these the mind can discover nothing there arises from the presupposition of the universal horizon above mentioned and its complete division the principle non datur vacuum formarum
this principle asserts that there are not different primitive and highest genera which stand isolated so to speak from each other but all the various genera are mere divisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus and hence follows immediately the principle datur continuum formarum
this principle indicates that all differences of species limit each other and do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus but only through smaller degrees of the difference between the one species and the other
in one word there are no species or subspecies which in the view of reason are the nearest possible to each other intermediate species or subspecies being always possible the difference of which from each of the former is always smaller than the difference existing between these
the first law therefore directs us to avoid the notion that there exist different primal genera and enounces the fact of perfect homogeneity the second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity and prescribes the distinction of subspecies before proceeding to apply our general conceptions to individuals
the third unites both the former by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in the most various diversity by means of the gradual transition from one species to another
thus it indicates a relationship between the different branches or species in so far as they all spring from the same stem
but this logical law of the continuum specierum formarum logicarum presupposes a transcendental principle lex continui in natura without which the understanding might be led into error by following the guidance of the former and thus perhaps pursuing a path contrary to that prescribed by nature
this law must consequently be based upon pure transcendental and not upon empirical considerations
for in the latter case it would come later than the system whereas it is really itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition of nature
these principles are not mere hypotheses employed for the purpose of experimenting upon nature although when any such connection is discovered it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypothetical unity as valid in the sphere of natureand thus they are in this respect not without their use
but we go farther and maintain that it is manifest that these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes variety in effects and affinity in phenomena are in accordance both with reason and nature and that they are not mere methods or plans devised for the purpose of assisting us in our observation of the external world
but it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea to which no adequate object can be discovered in experience
and this for two reasons
first because the species in nature are really divided and hence form quanta discreta and if the gradual progression through their affinity were continuous the intermediate members lying between two given species must be infinite in number which is impossible
secondly because we cannot make any determinate empirical use of this law inasmuch as it does not present us with any criterion of affinity which could aid us in determining how far we ought to pursue the graduation of differences it merely contains a general indication that it is our duty to seek for and if possible to discover them
when we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the order conformable to their employment in experience they will stand thus variety affinity unity each of them as ideas being taken in the highest degree of their completeness
reason presupposes the existence of cognitions of the understanding which have a direct relation to experience and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitionsa unity which far transcends all experience or empirical notions
the affinity of the diverse notwithstanding the differences existing between its parts has a relation to things but a still closer one to the mere properties and powers of things
for example imperfect experience may represent the orbits of the planets as circular
but we discover variations from this course and we proceed to suppose that the planets revolve in a path which if not a circle is of a character very similar to it
that is to say the movements of those planets which do not form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a circle and probably form an ellipse
the paths of comets exhibit still greater variations for so far as our observation extends they do not return upon their own course in a circle or ellipse
but we proceed to the conjecture that comets describe a parabola a figure which is closely allied to the ellipse
in fact a parabola is merely an ellipse with its longer axis produced to an indefinite extent
thus these principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms of these orbits and proceeding farther to a unity as regards the cause of the motions of the heavenly bodiesthat is gravitation
but we go on extending our conquests over nature and endeavour to explain all seeming deviations from these rules and even make additions to our system which no experience can ever substantiatefor example the theory in affinity with that of ellipses of hyperbolic paths of comets pursuing which these bodies leave our solar system and passing from sun to sun unite the most distant parts of the infinite universe which is held together by the same moving power
the most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles is that they seem to be transcendental and although only containing ideas for the guidance of the empirical exercise of reason and although this empirical employment stands to these ideas in an asymptotic relation alone to use a mathematical term that is continually approximate without ever being able to attain to them they possess notwithstanding as priori synthetical propositions objective though undetermined validity and are available as rules for possible experience
in the elaboration of our experience they may also be employed with great advantage as heuristic principles
a transcendental deduction of them cannot be made such a deduction being always impossible in the case of ideas as has been already shown
from the greek eurhioko
we distinguished in the transcendental analytic the dynamical principles of the understanding which are regulative principles of intuition from the mathematical which are constitutive principles of intuition
these dynamical laws are however constitutive in relation to experience inasmuch as they render the conceptions without which experience could not exist possible priori
but the principles of pure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empirical conceptions because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can be discovered and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto
now if i grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience as constitutive principles how shall i secure for them employment and objective validity as regulative principles and in what way can they be so employed
the understanding is the object of reason as sensibility is the object of the understanding
the production of systematic unity in all the empirical operations of the understanding is the proper occupation of reason just as it is the business of the understanding to connect the various content of phenomena by means of conceptions and subject them to empirical laws
but the operations of the understanding are without the schemata of sensibility undetermined and in the same manner the unity of reason is perfectly undetermined as regards the conditions under which and the extent to which the understanding ought to carry the systematic connection of its conceptions
but although it is impossible to discover in intuition a schema for the complete systematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding there must be some analogon of this schema
this analogon is the idea of the maximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in one principle
for we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an absolutely perfect all the restrictive conditions which are connected with an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted
thus the idea of reason is analogous with a sensuous schema with this difference that the application of the categories to the schema of reason does not present a cognition of any object as is the case with the application of the categories to sensuous schemata but merely provides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of the exercise of the understanding
now as every principle which imposes upon the exercise of the understanding priori compliance with the rule of systematic unity also relates although only in an indirect manner to an object of experience the principles of pure reason will also possess objective reality and validity in relation to experience
but they will not aim at determining our knowledge in regard to any empirical object they will merely indicate the procedure following which the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding may be in complete harmony and connection with itselfa result which is produced by its being brought into harmony with the principle of systematic unity so far as that is possible and deduced from it
i term all subjective principles which are not derived from observation of the constitution of an object but from the interest which reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognition of that object maxims of reason
thus there are maxims of speculative reason which are based solely upon its speculative interest although they appear to be objective principles
when principles which are really regulative are regarded as constitutive and employed as objective principles contradictions must arise but if they are considered as mere maxims there is no room for contradictions of any kind as they then merely indicate the different interests of reason which occasion differences in the mode of thought
in effect reason has only one single interest and the seeming contradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a difference in and a reciprocal limitation of the methods by which this interest is satisfied
this reasoner has at heart the interest of diversityin accordance with the principle of specification another the interest of unityin accordance with the principle of aggregation
each believes that his judgement rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he is examining and yet it has been influenced solely by a greater or less degree of adherence to some one of the two principles neither of which are objective but originate solely from the interest of reason and on this account to be termed maxims rather than principles
when i observe intelligent men disputing about the distinctive characteristics of men animals or plants and even of minerals those on the one side assuming the existence of certain national characteristics certain welldefined and hereditary distinctions of family race and so on while the other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of men with the same faculties and dispositions and that all differences are but the result of external and accidental circumstancesi have only to consider for a moment the real nature of the subject of discussion to arrive at the conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us to judge of and that there is little probability of either party being able to speak from a perfect insight into and understanding of the nature of the subject itself
both have in reality been struggling for the twofold interest of reason the one maintaining the one interest the other the other
but this difference between the maxims of diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted although so long as they are regarded as objective principles they must occasion not only contradictions and polemic but place hinderances in the way of the advancement of truth until some means is discovered of reconciling these conflicting interests and bringing reason into union and harmony with itself
the same is the case with the socalled law discovered by leibnitz and supported with remarkable ability by bonnetthe law of the continuous gradation of created beings which is nothing more than an inference from the principle of affinity for observation and study of the order of nature could never present it to the mind as an objective truth
the steps of this ladder as they appear in experience are too far apart from each other and the socalled petty differences between different kinds of animals are in nature commonly so wide separations that no confidence can be placed in such views particularly when we reflect on the great variety of things and the ease with which we can discover resemblances and no faith in the laws which are said to express the aims and purposes of nature
on the other hand the method of investigating the order of nature in the light of this principle and the maxim which requires us to regard this orderit being still undetermined how far it extendsas really existing in nature is beyond doubt a legitimate and excellent principle of reasona principle which extends farther than any experience or observation of ours and which without giving us any positive knowledge of anything in the region of experience guides us to the goal of systematic unity
of the ultimate end of the natural dialectic of human reason
the ideas of pure reason cannot be of themselves and in their own nature dialectical it is from their misemployment alone that fallacies and illusions arise
for they originate in the nature of reason itself and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for all the rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving of confidence and promotive of error
it is to be expected therefore that these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim
it is true the mob of sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency and contradiction and affect to despise the government of that faculty because they cannot understand its constitution while it is to its beneficial influences alone that they owe the position and the intelligence which enable them to criticize and to blame its procedure
we cannot employ an priori conception with certainty until we have made a transcendental deduction therefore
the ideas of pure reason do not admit of the same kind of deduction as the categories
but if they are to possess the least objective validity and to represent anything but mere creations of thought entia rationis ratiocinantis a deduction of them must be possible
this deduction will complete the critical task imposed upon pure reason and it is to this part of our labours that we now proceed
there is a great difference between a things being presented to the mind as an object in an absolute sense or merely as an ideal object
in the former case i employ my conceptions to determine the object in the latter case nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema which does not relate directly to an object not even in a hypothetical sense but which is useful only for the purpose of representing other objects to the mind in a mediate and indirect manner by means of their relation to the idea in the intellect
thus i say the conception of a supreme intelligence is a mere idea that is to say its objective reality does not consist in the fact that it has an immediate relation to an object for in this sense we have no means of establishing its objective validity it is merely a schema constructed according to the necessary conditions of the unity of reasonthe schema of a thing in general which is useful towards the production of the highest degree of systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason in which we deduce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object of this idea as the ground or cause of the said object of experience
in this way the idea is properly a heuristic and not an ostensive conception it does not give us any information respecting the constitution of an object it merely indicates how under the guidance of the idea we ought to investigate the constitution and the relations of objects in the world of experience
now if it can be shown that the three kinds of transcendental ideas psychological cosmological and theological although not relating directly to any object nor determining it do nevertheless on the supposition of the existence of an ideal object produce systematic unity in the laws of the empirical employment of the reason and extend our empirical cognition without ever being inconsistent or in opposition with itit must be a necessary maxim of reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas
and this forms the transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas not as constitutive principles of the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of our experience but as regulative principles of the systematic unity of empirical cognition which is by the aid of these ideas arranged and emended within its own proper limits to an extent unattainable by the operation of the principles of the understanding alone
i shall make this plainer
guided by the principles involved in these ideas we must in the first place so connect all the phenomena actions and feelings of the mind as if it were a simple substance which endowed with personal identity possesses a permanent existence in this life at least while its states among which those of the body are to be included as external conditions are in continual change
secondly in cosmology we must investigate the conditions of all natural phenomena internal as well as external as if they belonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or supreme member while we do not on this account deny the existence of intelligible grounds of these phenomena although we never employ them to explain phenomena for the simple reason that they are not objects of our cognition
thirdly in the sphere of theology we must regard the whole system of possible experience as forming an absolute but dependent and sensuouslyconditioned unity and at the same time as based upon a sole supreme and allsufficient ground existing apart from the world itselfa ground which is a selfsubsistent primeval and creative reason in relation to which we so employ our reason in the field of experience as if all objects drew their origin from that archetype of all reason
in other words we ought not to deduce the internal phenomena of the mind from a simple thinking substance but deduce them from each other under the guidance of the regulative idea of a simple being we ought not to deduce the phenomena order and unity of the universe from a supreme intelligence but merely draw from this idea of a supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in its connection of causes and effects
now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess an objective and hyperbolic existence except the cosmological ideas which lead reason into an antinomy the psychological and theological ideas are not antinomial
they contain no contradiction and how then can any one dispute their objective reality since he who denies it knows as little about their possibility as we who affirm and yet when we wish to admit the existence of a thing it is not sufficient to convince ourselves that there is no positive obstacle in the way for it cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of thought which transcend though they do not contradict all our conceptions as real and determinate objects solely upon the authority of a speculative reason striving to compass its own aims
they cannot therefore be admitted to be real in themselves they can only possess a comparative realitythat of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic unity of all cognition
they are to be regarded not as actual things but as in some measure analogous to them
we abstract from the object of the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of our understanding but which on the other hand are the sole conditions of our possessing a determinate conception of any given thing
and thus we cogitate a something of the real nature of which we have not the least conception but which we represent to ourselves as standing in a relation to the whole system of phenomena analogous to that in which phenomena stand to each other
by admitting these ideal beings we do not really extend our cognitions beyond the objects of possible experience we extend merely the empirical unity of our experience by the aid of systematic unity the schema of which is furnished by the idea which is therefore validnot as a constitutive but as a regulative principle
for although we posit a thing corresponding to the ideaa something an actual existencewe do not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by means of transcendent conceptions
this existence is purely ideal and not objective it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which is to be the guide of reason in the field of experience
there are no attempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be or what the real nature of this imaginary being
thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of god which is presented to us by speculative reason is in the strictest sense deistic
in other words reason does not assure us of the objective validity of the conception it merely gives us the idea of something on which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based
this something we cannot following the analogy of a real substance cogitate otherwise than as the cause of all things operating in accordance with rational laws if we regard it as an individual object although we should rest contented with the idea alone as a regulative principle of reason and make no attempt at completing the sum of the conditions imposed by thought
this attempt is indeed inconsistent with the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of cognitiona unity to which no bounds are set by reason
hence it happens that admitting a divine being i can have no conception of the internal possibility of its perfection or of the necessity of its existence
the only advantage of this admission is that it enables me to answer all other questions relating to the contingent and to give reason the most complete satisfaction as regards the unity which it aims at attaining in the world of experience
but i cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesis itself and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insight into the subject but its speculative interest alone which induces it to proceed from a point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition for the purpose of being able to consider all objects as parts of a systematic whole
here a distinction presents itself in regard to the way in which we may cogitate a presuppositiona distinction which is somewhat subtle but of great importance in transcendental philosophy
i may have sufficient grounds to admit something or the existence of something in a relative point of view suppositio relativa without being justified in admitting it in an absolute sense suppositio absoluta
this distinction is undoubtedly requisite in the case of a regulative principle the necessity of which we recognize though we are ignorant of the source and cause of that necessity and which we assume to be based upon some ultimate ground for the purpose of being able to cogitate the universality of the principle in a more determinate way
for example i cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to a pure transcendental idea
but i cannot admit that this being exists absolutely and in itself because all of the conceptions by which i can cogitate an object in a determinate manner fall short of assuring me of its existence nay the conditions of the objective validity of my conceptions are excluded by the ideaby the very fact of its being an idea
the conceptions of reality substance causality nay even that of necessity in existence have no significance out of the sphere of empirical cognition and cannot beyond that sphere determine any object
they may accordingly be employed to explain the possibility of things in the world of sense but they are utterly inadequate to explain the possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole because in this case the ground of explanation must lie out of and beyond the world and cannot therefore be an object of possible experience
now i may admit the existence of an incomprehensible being of this naturethe object of a mere idea relatively to the world of sense although i have no ground to admit its existence absolutely and in itself
for if an idea that of a systematic and complete unity of which i shall presently speak more particularly lies at the foundation of the most extended empirical employment of reason and if this idea cannot be adequately represented in concreto although it is indispensably necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to the highest possible degreei am not only authorized but compelled to realize this idea that is to posit a real object corresponding thereto
but i cannot profess to know this object it is to me merely a something to which as the ground of systematic unity in cognition i attribute such properties as are analogous to the conceptions employed by the understanding in the sphere of experience
following the analogy of the notions of reality substance causality and necessity i cogitate a being which possesses all these attributes in the highest degree and as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone i cogitate this being as selfsubsistent reason and as the cause of the universe operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmony and unity
thus i abstract all conditions that would limit my idea solely for the purpose of rendering systematic unity possible in the world of empirical diversity and thus securing the widest possible extension for the exercise of reason in that sphere
this i am enabled to do by regarding all connections and relations in the world of sense as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason of which our reason is but a faint image
i then proceed to cogitate this supreme being by conceptions which have properly no meaning or application except in the world of sense
but as i am authorized to employ the transcendental hypothesis of such a being in a relative respect alone that is as the substratum of the greatest possible unity in experiencei may attribute to a being which i regard as distinct from the world such properties as belong solely to the sphere of sense and experience
for i do not desire and am not justified in desiring to cognize this object of my idea as it exists in itself for i possess no conceptions sufficient for this task those of reality substance causality nay even that of necessity in existence losing all significance and becoming merely the signs of conceptions without content and without applicability when i attempt to carry them beyond the limits of the world of sense
i cogitate merely the relation of a perfectly unknown being to the greatest possible systematic unity of experience solely for the purpose of employing it as the schema of the regulative principle which directs reason in its empirical exercise
it is evident at the first view that we cannot presuppose the reality of this transcendental object by means of the conceptions of reality substance causality and so on because these conceptions cannot be applied to anything that is distinct from the world of sense
thus the supposition of a supreme being or cause is purely relative it is cogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience such a being is but a something of whose existence in itself we have not the least conception
thus too it becomes sufficiently manifest why we required the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given by sense although we can never have the least conception of this being or of its absolute necessity
and now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental dialectic and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reasonwhich become dialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness
pure reason is in fact occupied with itself and not with any object
objects are not presented to it to be embraced in the unity of an empirical conception it is only the cognitions of the understanding that are presented to it for the purpose of receiving the unity of a rational conception that is of being connected according to a principle
the unity of reason is the unity of system and this systematic unity is not an objective principle extending its dominion over objects but a subjective maxim extending its authority over the empirical cognition of objects
the systematic connection which reason gives to the empirical employment of the understanding not only advances the extension of that employment but ensures its correctness and thus the principle of a systematic unity of this nature is also objective although only in an indefinite respect principium vagum
it is not however a constitutive principle determining an object to which it directly relates it is merely a regulative principle or maxim advancing and strengthening the empirical exercise of reason by the opening up of new paths of which the understanding is ignorant while it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the sphere of experience
but reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity without at the same time cogitating an object of the ideaan object that cannot be presented in any experience which contains no concrete example of a complete systematic unity
this being ens rationis ratiocinatae is therefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is real absolutely and in itself
on the contrary it forms merely the problematical foundation of the connection which the mind introduces among the phenomena of the sensuous world
we look upon this connection in the light of the abovementioned idea as if it drew its origin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea
and yet all we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for the systematic unity of experiencea unity indispensable to reason advantageous to the understanding and promotive of the interests of empirical cognition
we mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as an enouncement or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence of a real thing which we are to regard as the origin or ground of a systematic constitution of the universe
on the contrary it is left completely undetermined what the nature or properties of this socalled ground may be
the idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view from which this unity so essential to reason and so beneficial to the understanding may be regarded as radiating
in one word this transcendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle by means of which reason so far as in her lies extends the dominion of systematic unity over the whole sphere of experience
the first object of an idea of this kind is the ego considered merely as a thinking nature or soul
if i wish to investigate the properties of a thinking being i must interrogate experience
but i find that i can apply none of the categories to this object the schema of these categories which is the condition of their application being given only in sensuous intuition
but i cannot thus attain to the cognition of a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense
instead therefore of an empirical conception of what the soul really is reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all thought and by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive constructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance which is in itself unchangeable possessing personal identity and in connection with other real things external to it in one word it constructs the idea of a simple selfsubsistent intelligence
but the real aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles of systematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul
that is reason desires to be able to represent all the determinations of the internal sense as existing in one subject all powers as deduced from one fundamental power all changes as mere varieties in the condition of a being which is permanent and always the same and all phenomena in space as entirely different in their nature from the procedure of thought
essential simplicity with the other attributes predicated of the ego is regarded as the mere schema of this regulative principle it is not assumed that it is the actual ground of the properties of the soul
for these properties may rest upon quite different grounds of which we are completely ignorant just as the above predicates could not give us any knowledge of the soul as it is in itself even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it inasmuch as they constitute a mere idea which cannot be represented in concreto
nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of this kind if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than an idea that is if we regard it as valid merely in relation to the employment of reason in the sphere of the phenomena of the soul
under the guidance of this idea or principle no empirical laws of corporeal phenomena are called in to explain that which is a phenomenon of the internal sense alone no windy hypotheses of the generation annihilation and palingenesis of souls are admitted
thus the consideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure and unmixed with heterogeneous elements while the investigation of reason aims at reducing all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphere of knowledge to a single principle
all this is best effected nay cannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema which requires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence
the psychological idea is therefore meaningless and inapplicable except as the schema of a regulative conception
for if i ask whether the soul is not really of a spiritual natureit is a question which has no meaning
from such a conception has been abstracted not merely all corporeal nature but all nature that is all the predicates of a possible experience and consequently all the conditions which enable us to cogitate an object to this conception have disappeared
but if these conditions are absent it is evident that the conception is meaningless
the second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception of the universe
for nature is properly the only object presented to us in regard to which reason requires regulative principles
nature is twofoldthinking and corporeal nature
to cogitate the latter in regard to its internal possibility that is to determine the application of the categories to it no idea is requiredno representation which transcends experience
in this sphere therefore an idea is impossible sensuous intuition being our only guide while in the sphere of psychology we require the fundamental idea i which contains priori a certain form of thought namely the unity of the ego
pure reason has therefore nothing left but nature in general and the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some principle
the absolute totality of the series of these conditions is an idea which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise of reason while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reason in relation to that totality
it requires us in the explanation of given phenomena in the regress or ascent in the series to proceed as if the series were infinite in itself that is were prolonged in indefinitum while on the other hand where reason is regarded as itself the determining cause in the region of freedom we are required to proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense but of the pure understanding
in this latter case the conditions do not exist in the series of phenomena but may be placed quite out of and beyond it and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had an absolute beginning from an intelligible cause
all this proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles and not constitutive and that their aim is not to realize an actual totality in such series
the full discussion of this subject will be found in its proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason
the third idea of pure reason containing the hypothesis of a being which is valid merely as a relative hypothesis is that of the one and allsufficient cause of all cosmological series in other words the idea of god
we have not the slightest ground absolutely to admit the existence of an object corresponding to this idea for what can empower or authorize us to affirm the existence of a being of the highest perfectiona being whose existence is absolutely necessarymerely because we possess the conception of such a being the answer is it is the existence of the world which renders this hypothesis necessary
but this answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea of this being like all other speculative ideas is essentially nothing more than a demand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it and its subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world by principles of systematic unity and consequently that it shall regard all phenomena as originating from one allembracing being as the supreme and allsufficient cause
from this it is plain that the only aim of reason in this procedure is the establishment of its own formal rule for the extension of its dominion in the world of experience that it does not aim at an extension of its cognition beyond the limits of experience and that consequently this idea does not contain any constitutive principle
the highest formal unity which is based upon ideas alone is the unity of all thingsa unity in accordance with an aim or purpose and the speculative interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all order in the world as if it originated from the intention and design of a supreme reason
this principle unfolds to the view of reason in the sphere of experience new and enlarged prospects and invites it to connect the phenomena of the world according to teleological laws and in this way to attain to the highest possible degree of systematic unity
the hypothesis of a supreme intelligence as the sole cause of the universean intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal existenceis accordingly always of the greatest service to reason
thus if we presuppose in relation to the figure of the earth which is round but somewhat flattened at the poles or that of mountains or seas wise designs on the part of an author of the universe we cannot fail to make by the light of this supposition a great number of interesting discoveries
if we keep to this hypothesis as a principle which is purely regulative even error cannot be very detrimental
for in this case error can have no more serious consequences than that where we expected to discover a teleological connection nexus finalis only a mechanical or physical connection appears
in such a case we merely fail to find the additional form of unity we expected but we do not lose the rational unity which the mind requires in its procedure in experience
but even a miscarriage of this sort cannot affect the law in its general and teleological relations
for although we may convict an anatomist of an error when he connects the limb of some animal with a certain purpose it is quite impossible to prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature be it what it may is entirely without aim or design
and thus medical physiology by the aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason extends its very limited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts of an organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmost confidence and with the approbation of all reflecting men that every organ or bodily part of an animal has its use and answers a certain design
now this is a supposition which if regarded as of a constitutive character goes much farther than any experience or observation of ours can justify
hence it is evident that it is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason which aims at the highest degree of systematic unity by the aid of the idea of a causality according to design in a supreme causea cause which it regards as the highest intelligence
the advantages which a circular form in the case of the earth has over every other are well known
but few are aware that the slight flattening at the poles which gives it the figure of a spheroid is the only cause which prevents the elevations of continents or even of mountains perhaps thrown up by some internal convulsion from continually altering the position of the axis of the earthand that to some considerable degree in a short time
the great protuberance of the earth under the equator serves to overbalance the impetus of all other masses of earth and thus to preserve the axis of the earth so far as we can observe in its present position
and yet this wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the equilibrium of the formerly fluid mass
if however we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely regulative influence reason is betrayed into numerous errors
for it has then left the ground of experience in which alone are to be found the criteria of truth and has ventured into the region of the incomprehensible and unsearchable on the heights of which it loses its power and collectedness because it has completely severed its connection with experience
the first error which arises from our employing the idea of a supreme being as a constitutive in repugnance to the very nature of an idea and not as a regulative principle is the error of inactive reason ignava ratio
we may so term every principle which requires us to regard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete and allows reason to cease its inquiries as if it had fully executed its task
thus the psychological idea of the ego when employed as a constitutive principle for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul and for the extension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits of experienceeven to the condition of the soul after deathis convenient enough for the purposes of pure reason but detrimental and even ruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience
the dogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of our personality through all changes of condition from the unity of a thinking substance the interest which we take in things and events that can happen only after our death from a consciousness of the immaterial nature of our thinking subject and so on
thus he dispenses with all empirical investigations into the cause of these internal phenomena and with all possible explanations of them upon purely natural grounds while at the dictation of a transcendent reason he passes by the immanent sources of cognition in experience greatly to his own ease and convenience but to the sacrifice of all genuine insight and intelligence
these prejudicial consequences become still more evident in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a supreme intelligence and the theological system of nature physicotheology which is falsely based upon it
for in this case the aims which we observe in nature and often those which we merely fancy to exist make the investigation of causes a very easy task by directing us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to the unsearchable will and counsel of the supreme wisdom while we ought to investigate their causes in the general laws of the mechanism of matter
we are thus recommended to consider the labour of reason as ended when we have merely dispensed with its employment which is guided surely and safely only by the order of nature and the series of changes in the worldwhich are arranged according to immanent and general laws
this error may be avoided if we do not merely consider from the viewpoint of final aims certain parts of nature such as the division and structure of a continent the constitution and direction of certain mountainchains or even the organization existing in the vegetable and animal kingdoms but look upon this systematic unity of nature in a perfectly general way in relation to the idea of a supreme intelligence
if we pursue this advice we lay as a foundation for all investigation the conformity to aims of all phenomena of nature in accordance with universal laws for which no particular arrangement of nature is exempt but only cognized by us with more or less difficulty and we possess a regulative principle of the systematic unity of a teleological connection which we do not attempt to anticipate or predetermine
all that we do and ought to do is to follow out the physicomechanical connection in nature according to general laws with the hope of discovering sooner or later the teleological connection also
thus and thus only can the principle of final unity aid in the extension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience without being in any case detrimental to its interests
this was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a sophistical argument which ran thus if it is your fate to die of this disease you will die whether you employ a physician or not
cicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation because if followed it puts an end to the employment of reason in the affairs of life
for a similar reason i have applied this designation to the sophistical argument of pure reason
the second error which arises from the misconception of the principle of systematic unity is that of perverted reason perversa ratio usteron roteron rationis
the idea of systematic unity is available as a regulative principle in the connection of phenomena according to general natural laws and how far soever we have to travel upon the path of experience to discover some fact or event this idea requires us to believe that we have approached all the more nearly to the completion of its use in the sphere of nature although that completion can never be attained
but this error reverses the procedure of reason
we begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity and by giving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a supreme intelligence and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature
thus not only does teleology which ought to aid in the completion of unity in accordance with general laws operate to the destruction of its influence but it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim that is the proof upon natural grounds of the existence of a supreme intelligent cause
for if we cannot presuppose supreme finality in nature priori that is as essentially belonging to nature how can we be directed to endeavour to discover this unity and rising gradually through its different degrees to approach the supreme perfection of an author of alla perfection which is absolutely necessary and therefore cognizable priori the regulative principle directs us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and consequently as following from the essential nature of thingsbut only as a unity of nature not merely cognized empirically but presupposed priori although only in an indeterminate manner
but if i insist on basing nature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining being the unity of nature is in effect lost
for in this case it is quite foreign and unessential to the nature of things and cannot be cognized from the general laws of nature
and thus arises a vicious circular argument what ought to have been proved having been presupposed
to take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for a constitutive principle and to hypostatize and make a cause out of that which is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmonious exercise of reason involves reason in inextricable embarrassments
the investigation of nature pursues its own path under the guidance of the chain of natural causes in accordance with the general laws of nature and ever follows the light of the idea of an author of the universenot for the purpose of deducing the finality which it constantly pursues from this supreme being but to attain to the cognition of his existence from the finality which it seeks in the existence of the phenomena of nature and if possible in that of all things to cognize this being consequently as absolutely necessary
whether this latter purpose succeed or not the idea is and must always be a true one and its employment when merely regulative must always be accompanied by truthful and beneficial results
complete unity in conformity with aims constitutes absolute perfection
but if we do not find this unity in the nature of the things which go to constitute the world of experience that is of objective cognition consequently in the universal and necessary laws of nature how can we infer from this unity the idea of the supreme and absolutely necessary perfection of a primal being which is the origin of all causality the greatest systematic unity and consequently teleological unity constitutes the very foundation of the possibility of the most extended employment of human reason
the idea of unity is therefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of our reason
this idea is a legislative one and hence it is very natural that we should assume the existence of a legislative reason corresponding to it from which the systematic unity of naturethe object of the operations of reasonmust be derived
in the course of our discussion of the antinomies we stated that it is always possible to answer all the questions which pure reason may raise and that the plea of the limited nature of our cognition which is unavoidable and proper in many questions regarding natural phenomena cannot in this case be admitted because the questions raised do not relate to the nature of things but are necessarily originated by the nature of reason itself and relate to its own internal constitution
we can now establish this assertion which at first sight appeared so rash in relation to the two questions in which reason takes the greatest interest and thus complete our discussion of the dialectic of pure reason
if then the question is asked in relation to transcendental theology first whether there is anything distinct from the world which contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according to general laws the answer is certainly
for the world is a sum of phenomena there must therefore be some transcendental basis of these phenomena that is a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone
if secondly the question is asked whether this being is substance whether it is of the greatest reality whether it is necessary and so forth i answer that this question is utterly without meaning
for all the categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannot be employed except in the world of sense and are without meaning when not applied to objects of actual or possible experience
out of this sphere they are not properly conceptions but the mere marks or indices of conceptions which we may admit although they cannot without the help of experience help us to understand any subject or thing
if thirdly the question is whether we may not cogitate this being which is distinct from the world in analogy with the objects of experience the answer is undoubtedly but only as an ideal and not as a real object
that is we must cogitate it only as an unknown substratum of the systematic unity order and finality of the worlda unity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of its investigation of nature
nay more we may admit into the idea certain anthropomorphic elements which are promotive of the interests of this regulative principle
for it is no more than an idea which does not relate directly to a being distinct from the world but to the regulative principle of the systematic unity of the world by means however of a schema of this unitythe schema of a supreme intelligence who is the wiselydesigning author of the universe
what this basis of cosmical unity may be in itself we know notwe cannot discover from the idea we merely know how we ought to employ the idea of this unity in relation to the systematic operation of reason in the sphere of experience
after what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and its proper employment as a regulative principle of the operations of reason i need not enter into details regarding the transcendental illusion by which the systematic unity of all the various phenomena of the internal sense is hypostatized
the procedure is in this case very similar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the theological ideal
but it will be asked again can we on these grounds admit the existence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world without doubt and not only so but we must assume the existence of such a being
but do we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience by no means
for we have merely presupposed a something of which we have no conception which we do not know as it is in itself but in relation to the systematic disposition of the universe which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature we have cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligent existence an empirical conception that is to say we have endowed it with those attributes which judging from the nature of our own reason may contain the ground of such a systematic unity
this idea is therefore valid only relatively to the employment in experience of our reason
but if we attribute to it absolute and objective validity we overlook the fact that it is merely an ideal being that we cogitate and by setting out from a basis which is not determinable by considerations drawn from experience we place ourselves in a position which incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empirical employment of reason
but it will be asked further can i make any use of this conception and hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature yes for this very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental basis
but may i regard certain arrangements which seemed to have been made in conformity with some fixed aim as the arrangements of design and look upon them as proceeding from the divine will with the intervention however of certain other particular arrangements disposed to that end yes you may do so but at the same time you must regard it as indifferent whether it is asserted that divine wisdom has disposed all things in conformity with his highest aims or that the idea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigation of nature and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity of nature according to general laws even in those cases where we are unable to discover that unity
in other words it must be perfectly indifferent to you whether you say when you have discovered this unity god has wisely willed it so or nature has wisely arranged this
for it was nothing but the systematic unity which reason requires as a basis for the investigation of nature that justified you in accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for a regulative principle and the farther you advance in the discovery of design and finality the more certain the validity of your idea
but as the whole aim of this regulative principle was the discovery of a necessary and systematic unity in nature we have in so far as we attain this to attribute our success to the idea of a supreme being while at the same time we cannot without involving ourselves in contradictions overlook the general laws of nature as it was in reference to them alone that this idea was employed
we cannot i say overlook the general laws of nature and regard this conformity to aims observable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin inasmuch as there is no ground which can justify us in the admission of a being with such properties distinct from and above nature
all that we are authorized to assert is that this idea may be employed as a principle and that the properties of the being which is assumed to correspond to it may be regarded as systematically connected in analogy with the causal determination of phenomena
for the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea of the supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements for without these we could not predicate anything of it we may regard it as allowable to cogitate this cause as a being with understanding the feelings of pleasure and displeasure and faculties of desire and will corresponding to these
at the same time we may attribute to this being infinite perfectiona perfection which necessarily transcends that which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorize us to predicate of it
for the regulative law of systematic unity requires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and final unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable even in the highest diversity
for although we may discover little of this cosmical perfection it belongs to the legislative prerogative of reason to require us always to seek for and to expect it while it must always be beneficial to institute all inquiries into nature in accordance with this principle
but it is evident that by this idea of a supreme author of all which i place as the foundation of all inquiries into nature i do not mean to assert the existence of such a being or that i have any knowledge of its existence and consequently i do not really deduce anything from the existence of this being but merely from its idea that is to say from the nature of things in this world in accordance with this idea
a certain dim consciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated to the philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them regarding the cause of the world
we find them employing the expressions wisdom and care of nature and divine wisdom as synonymousnay in purely speculative discussions preferring the former because it does not carry the appearance of greater pretensions than such as we are entitled to make and at the same time directs reason to its proper field of actionnature and her phenomena
thus pure reason which at first seemed to promise us nothing less than the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience is found when thoroughly examined to contain nothing but regulative principles the virtue and function of which is to introduce into our cognition a higher degree of unity than the understanding could of itself
these principles by placing the goal of all our struggles at so great a distance realize for us the most thorough connection between the different parts of our cognition and the highest degree of systematic unity
but on the other hand if misunderstood and employed as constitutive principles of transcendent cognition they become the parents of illusions and contradictions while pretending to introduce us to new regions of knowledge
thus all human cognition begins with intuitions proceeds from thence to conceptions and ends with ideas
although it possesses in relation to all three elements priori sources of cognition which seemed to transcend the limits of all experience a thoroughgoing criticism demonstrates that speculative reason can never by the aid of these elements pass the bounds of possible experience and that the proper destination of this highest faculty of cognition is to employ all methods and all the principles of these methods for the purpose of penetrating into the innermost secrets of nature by the aid of the principles of unity among all kinds of which teleological unity is the highest while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere of experience beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane
the critical examination in our transcendental analytic of all the propositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of experience completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a possible experience
if we were not distrustful even of the clearest abstract theorems if we were not allured by specious and inviting prospects to escape from the constraining power of their evidence we might spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the dialectical arguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of its pretensions for we should know with the most complete certainty that however honest such professions might be they are null and valueless because they relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by any possibility attain
but as there is no end to discussion if we cannot discover the true cause of the illusions by which even the wisest are deceived and as the analysis of all our transcendent cognition into its elements is of itself of no slight value as a psychological study while it is a duty incumbent on every philosopherit was found necessary to investigate the dialectical procedure of reason in its primary sources
and as the inferences of which this dialectic is the parent are not only deceitful but naturally possess a profound interest for humanity it was advisable at the same time to give a full account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure and to deposit it in the archives of human reason as a warning to all future metaphysicians to avoid these causes of speculative error
ii
transcendental doctrine of method
if we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an edifice the idea of which at least exists in the human mind it may be said that we have in the transcendental doctrine of elements examined the materials and determined to what edifice these belong and what its height and stability
we have found indeed that although we had purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach to heaven the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation which was spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes and high enough to enable us to survey the level plain of experience but that the bold undertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materialsnot to mention the confusion of tongues which gave rise to endless disputes among the labourers on the plan of the edifice and at last scattered them over all the world each to erect a separate building for himself according to his own plans and his own inclinations
our present task relates not to the materials but to the plan of an edifice and as we have had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design which may be found to transcend our natural powers while at the same time we cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for the mind we must proportion our design to the material which is presented to us and which is at the same time sufficient for all our wants
i understand then by the transcendental doctrine of method the determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason
we shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline the canon the architectonic and finally the history of pure reason
this part of our critique will accomplish from the transcendental point of view what has been usually attempted but miserably executed under the name of practical logic
it has been badly executed i say because general logic not being limited to any particular kind of cognition not even to the pure cognition of the understanding nor to any particular objects it cannot without borrowing from other sciences do more than present merely the titles or signs of possible methods and the technical expressions which are employed in the systematic parts of all sciences and thus the pupil is made acquainted with names the meaning and application of which he is to learn only at some future time
chapter i
the discipline of pure reason
negative judgementsthose which are so not merely as regards their logical form but in respect of their contentare not commonly held in especial respect
they are on the contrary regarded as jealous enemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge and it almost requires an apology to induce us to tolerate much less to prize and to respect them
all propositions indeed may be logically expressed in a negative form but in relation to the content of our cognition the peculiar province of negative judgements is solely to prevent error
for this reason too negative propositions which are framed for the purpose of correcting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible are undoubtedly true but inane and senseless that is they are in reality purposeless and for this reason often very ridiculous
such is the proposition of the schoolman that alexander could not have subdued any countries without an army
but where the limits of our possible cognition are very much contracted the attraction to new fields of knowledge great the illusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character and the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitudethe negative element in knowledge which is useful only to guard us against error is of far more importance than much of that positive instruction which makes additions to the sum of our knowledge
the restraint which is employed to repress and finally to extirpate the constant inclination to depart from certain rules is termed discipline
it is distinguished from culture which aims at the formation of a certain degree of skill without attempting to repress or to destroy any other mental power already existing
in the cultivation of a talent which has given evidence of an impulse towards selfdevelopment discipline takes a negative culture and doctrine a positive part
i am well aware that in the language of the schools the term discipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction
but there are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the notion of the former as a course of corrective training from that of the latter as the communication of knowledge and the nature of things itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable expressions for this distinction that it is my desire that the former terms should never be employed in any other than a negative signification
that natural dispositions and talents such as imagination and wit which ask a free and unlimited development require in many respects the corrective influence of discipline every one will readily grant
but it may well appear strange that reason whose proper duty it is to prescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind should itself require this corrective
it has in fact hitherto escaped this humiliation only because in presence of its magnificent pretensions and high position no one could readily suspect it to be capable of substituting fancies for conceptions and words for things
reason when employed in the field of experience does not stand in need of criticism because its principles are subjected to the continual test of empirical observations
nor is criticism requisite in the sphere of mathematics where the conceptions of reason must always be presented in concreto in pure intuition and baseless or arbitrary assertions are discovered without difficulty
but where reason is not held in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pure intuition that is when it is employed in the transcendental sphere of pure conceptions it stands in great need of discipline to restrain its propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and to keep it from wandering into error
in fact the utility of the philosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character
particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions and the causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism
but where we find as in the case of pure reason a complete system of illusions and fallacies closely connected with each other and depending upon grand general principles there seems to be required a peculiar and negative code of mental legislation which under the denomination of a discipline and founded upon the nature of reason and the objects of its exercise shall constitute a system of thorough examination and testing which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk
but the reader must remark that in this the second division of our transcendental critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed to the content but to the method of the cognition of pure reason
the former task has been completed in the doctrine of elements
but there is so much similarity in the mode of employing the faculty of reason whatever be the object to which it is applied while at the same time its employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially different in kind from every other that without the warning negative influence of a discipline specially directed to that end the errors are unavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the methods which are originated by reason but which are out of place in this sphere
section i
the discipline of pure reason in the sphere of dogmatism
the science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the extension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience
examples are always contagious and they exert an especial influence on the same faculty which naturally flatters itself that it will have the same good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunate instance
hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire in the transcendental sphere with equal success and security especially when it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliant results in the science of mathematics
it is therefore of the highest importance for us to know whether the method of arriving at demonstrative certainty which is termed mathematical be identical with that by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certainty in philosophy and which is termed in that science dogmatical
philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of conceptions mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the construction of conceptions
the construction of a conception is the presentation priori of the intuition which corresponds to the conception
for this purpose a nonempirical intuition is requisite which as an intuition is an individual object while as the construction of a conception a general representation it must be seen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which rank under that conception
thus i construct a triangle by the presentation of the object which corresponds to this conception either by mere imagination in pure intuition or upon paper in empirical intuition in both cases completely priori without borrowing the type of that figure from any experience
the individual figure drawn upon paper is empirical but it serves notwithstanding to indicate the conception even in its universality because in this empirical intuition we keep our eye merely on the act of the construction of the conception and pay no attention to the various modes of determining it for example its size the length of its sides the size of its angles these not in the least affecting the essential character of the conception
philosophical cognition accordingly regards the particular only in the general mathematical the general in the particular nay in the individual
this is done however entirely priori and by means of pure reason so that as this individual figure is determined under certain universal conditions of construction the object of the conception to which this individual figure corresponds as its schema must be cogitated as universally determined
the essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists therefore in this formal quality it does not regard the difference of the matter or objects of both
those thinkers who aim at distinguishing philosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with quality merely and the latter with quantity have mistaken the effect for the cause
the reason why mathematical cognition can relate only to quantity is to be found in its form alone
for it is the conception of quantities only that is capable of being constructed that is presented priori in intuition while qualities cannot be given in any other than an empirical intuition
hence the cognition of qualities by reason is possible only through conceptions
no one can find an intuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality except in experience it cannot be presented to the mind priori and antecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality
we can form an intuition by means of the mere conception of it of a cone without the aid of experience but the colour of the cone we cannot know except from experience
i cannot present an intuition of a cause except in an example which experience offers to me
besides philosophy as well as mathematics treats of quantities as for example of totality infinity and so on
mathematics too treats of the difference of lines and surfacesas spaces of different quality of the continuity of extensionas a quality thereof
but although in such cases they have a common object the mode in which reason considers that object is very different in philosophy from what it is in mathematics
the former confines itself to the general conceptions the latter can do nothing with a mere conception it hastens to intuition
in this intuition it regards the conception in concreto not empirically but in an priori intuition which it has constructed and in which all the results which follow from the general conditions of the construction of the conception are in all cases valid for the object of the constructed conception
suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and that he is required to discover by the philosophical method what relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle
he has nothing before him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three right lines and consequently with the same number of angles
he may analyse the conception of a right line of an angle or of the number three as long as he pleases but he will not discover any properties not contained in these conceptions
but if this question is proposed to a geometrician he at once begins by constructing a triangle
he knows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous angles which proceed from one point in a straight line and he goes on to produce one side of his triangle thus forming two adjacent angles which are together equal to two right angles
he then divides the exterior of these angles by drawing a line parallel with the opposite side of the triangle and immediately perceives that he has thus got an exterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior
proceeding in this way through a chain of inferences and always on the ground of intuition he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the question
but mathematics does not confine itself to the construction of quantities quanta as in the case of geometry it occupies itself with pure quantity also quantitas as in the case of algebra where complete abstraction is made of the properties of the object indicated by the conception of quantity
in algebra a certain method of notation by signs is adopted and these indicate the different possible constructions of quantities the extraction of roots and so on
after having thus denoted the general conception of quantities according to their different relations the different operations by which quantity or number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition in accordance with general rules
thus when one quantity is to be divided by another the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiar to the operation of division and thus algebra by means of a symbolical construction of quantity just as geometry with its ostensive or geometrical construction a construction of the objects themselves arrives at results which discursive cognition cannot hope to reach by the aid of mere conceptions
now what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the philosopher and the mathematician the former of whom follows the path of conceptions while the latter pursues that of intuitions which he represents priori in correspondence with his conceptions the cause is evident from what has been already demonstrated in the introduction to this critique
we do not in the present case want to discover analytical propositions which may be produced merely by analysing our conceptionsfor in this the philosopher would have the advantage over his rival we aim at the discovery of synthetical propositionssuch synthetical propositions moreover as can be cognized priori
i must not confine myself to that which i actually cogitate in my conception of a triangle for this is nothing more than the mere definition i must try to go beyond that and to arrive at properties which are not contained in although they belong to the conception
now this is impossible unless i determine the object present to my mind according to the conditions either of empirical or of pure intuition
in the former case i should have an empirical proposition arrived at by actual measurement of the angles of the triangle which would possess neither universality nor necessity but that would be of no value
in the latter i proceed by geometrical construction by means of which i collect in a pure intuition just as i would in an empirical intuition all the various properties which belong to the schema of a triangle in general and consequently to its conception and thus construct synthetical propositions which possess the attribute of universality
it would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle that is to reflect on it discursively i should get no further than the definition with which i had been obliged to set out
there are certainly transcendental synthetical propositions which are framed by means of pure conceptions and which form the peculiar distinction of philosophy but these do not relate to any particular thing but to a thing in general and enounce the conditions under which the perception of it may become a part of possible experience
but the science of mathematics has nothing to do with such questions nor with the question of existence in any fashion it is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves only in so far as these are connected with the conception of the objects
in the above example we merely attempted to show the great difference which exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere of conceptions and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction of conceptions
the question naturally arises what is the cause which necessitates this twofold exercise of reason and how are we to discover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method which reason is pursuing in an argument
all our knowledge relates finally to possible intuitions for it is these alone that present objects to the mind
an priori or nonempirical conception contains either a pure intuitionand in this case it can be constructed or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions which are not given priori
in this latter case it may help us to form synthetical priori judgements but only in the discursive method by conceptions not in the intuitive by means of the construction of conceptions
the only priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomenaspace and time
a conception of space and time as quanta may be presented priori in intuition that is constructed either alone with their quality figure or as pure quantity the mere synthesis of the homogeneous by means of number
but the matter of phenomena by which things are given in space and time can be presented only in perception posteriori
the only conception which represents priori this empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing in general and the priori synthetical cognition of this conception can give us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may be contained in the corresponding posteriori perception it is utterly inadequate to present an priori intuition of the real object which must necessarily be empirical
synthetical propositions which relate to things in general an priori intuition of which is impossible are transcendental
for this reason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the construction of conceptions they are priori and based entirely on conceptions themselves
they contain merely the rule by which we are to seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unity of that which cannot be intuited priori
but they are incompetent to present any of the conceptions which appear in them in an priori intuition these can be given only posteriori in experience which however is itself possible only through these synthetical principles
if we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception we must go beyond it to the intuition in which it is given
if we keep to what is contained in the conception the judgement is merely analyticalit is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in the conception
but i can pass from the conception to the pure or empirical intuition which corresponds to it
i can proceed to examine my conception in concreto and to cognize either priori or a posterio what i find in the object of the conception
the former priori cognitionis rationalmathematical cognition by means of the construction of the conception the latter posteriori cognitionis purely empirical cognition which does not possess the attributes of necessity and universality
thus i may analyse the conception i have of gold but i gain no new information from this analysis i merely enumerate the different properties which i had connected with the notion indicated by the word
my knowledge has gained in logical clearness and arrangement but no addition has been made to it
but if i take the matter which is indicated by this name and submit it to the examination of my senses i am enabled to form several syntheticalalthough still empiricalpropositions
the mathematical conception of a triangle i should construct that is present priori in intuition and in this way attain to rationalsynthetical cognition
but when the transcendental conception of reality or substance or power is presented to my mind i find that it does not relate to or indicate either an empirical or pure intuition but that it indicates merely the synthesis of empirical intuitions which cannot of course be given priori
the synthesis in such a conception cannot proceed prioriwithout the aid of experienceto the intuition which corresponds to the conception and for this reason none of these conceptions can produce a determinative synthetical proposition they can never present more than a principle of the synthesis of possible empirical intuitions
a transcendental proposition is therefore a synthetical cognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursive method and it renders possible all synthetical unity in empirical cognition though it cannot present us with any intuition priori
in the case of the conception of cause i do really go beyond the empirical conception of an eventbut not to the intuition which presents this conception in concreto but only to the timeconditions which may be found in experience to correspond to the conception
my procedure is therefore strictly according to conceptions i cannot in a case of this kind employ the construction of conceptions because the conception is merely a rule for the synthesis of perceptions which are not pure intuitions and which therefore cannot be given priori
there is thus a twofold exercise of reason
both modes have the properties of universality and an priori origin in common but are in their procedure of widely different character
the reason of this is that in the world of phenomena in which alone objects are presented to our minds there are two main elementsthe form of intuition space and time which can be cognized and determined completely priori and the matter or contentthat which is presented in space and time and which consequently contains a somethingan existence corresponding to our powers of sensation
as regards the latter which can never be given in a determinate mode except by experience there are no priori notions which relate to it except the undetermined conceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations in so far as these belong in a possible experience to the unity of consciousness
as regards the former we can determine our conceptions priori in intuition inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of the conceptions in space and timethese objects being regarded simply as quanta
in the one case reason proceeds according to conceptions and can do nothing more than subject phenomena to thesewhich can only be determined empirically that is posterioriin conformity however with those conceptions as the rules of all empirical synthesis
in the other case reason proceeds by the construction of conceptions and as these conceptions relate to an priori intuition they may be given and determined in pure intuition priori and without the aid of empirical data
the examination and consideration of everything that exists in space or timewhether it is a quantum or not in how far the particular something which fills space or time is a primary substratum or a mere determination of some other existence whether it relates to anything elseeither as cause or effect whether its existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and dependence upon others the possibility of this existence its reality and necessity or oppositesall these form part of the cognition of reason on the ground of conceptions and this cognition is termed philosophical
but to determine priori an intuition in space its figure to divide time into periods or merely to cognize the quantity of an intuition in space and time and to determine it by numberall this is an operation of reason by means of the construction of conceptions and is called mathematical
the success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere of mathematics naturally fosters the expectation that the same good fortune will be its lot if it applies the mathematical method in other regions of mental endeavour besides that of quantities
its success is thus great because it can support all its conceptions by priori intuitions and in this way make itself a master as it were over nature while pure philosophy with its priori discursive conceptions bungles about in the world of nature and cannot accredit or show any priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions
masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of this method indeed it is a common persuasion that it is capable of being applied to any subject of human thought
they have hardly ever reflected or philosophized on their favourite sciencea task of great difficulty and the specific difference between the two modes of employing the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts
rules current in the field of common experience and which common sense stamps everywhere with its approval are regarded by them as axiomatic
from what source the conceptions of space and time with which as the only primitive quanta they have to deal enter their minds is a question which they do not trouble themselves to answer and they think it just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pure conceptions of the understanding and the extent of their validity
all they have to do with them is to employ them
in all this they are perfectly right if they do not overstep the limits of the sphere of nature
but they pass unconsciously from the world of sense to the insecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions instabilis tellus innabilis unda where they can neither stand nor swim and where the tracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time while the march of mathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway which the latest posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment
as we have taken upon us the task of determining clearly and certainly the limits of pure reason in the sphere of transcendentalism and as the efforts of reason in this direction are persisted in even after the plainest and most expressive warnings hope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into the splendours of the intellectual worldit becomes necessary to cut away the last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope
we shall accordingly show that the mathematical method is unattended in the sphere of philosophy by the least advantageexcept perhaps that it more plainly exhibits its own inadequacythat geometry and philosophy are two quite different things although they go hand in hand in the field of natural science and consequently that the procedure of the one can never be imitated by the other
the evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions axioms and demonstrations
i shall be satisfied with showing that none of these forms can be employed or imitated in philosophy in the sense in which they are understood by mathematicians and that the geometrician if he employs his method in philosophy will succeed only in building cardcastles while the employment of the philosophical method in mathematics can result in nothing but mere verbiage
the essential business of philosophy indeed is to mark out the limits of the science and even the mathematician unless his talent is naturally circumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge cannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy or set himself above its direction
i
of definitions
a definition is as the term itself indicates the representation upon primary grounds of the complete conception of a thing within its own limits
accordingly an empirical conception cannot be defined it can only be explained
for as there are in such a conception only a certain number of marks or signs which denote a certain class of sensuous objects we can never be sure that we do not cogitate under the word which indicates the same object at one time a greater at another a smaller number of signs
thus one person may cogitate in his conception of gold in addition to its properties of weight colour malleability that of resisting rust while another person may be ignorant of this quality
we employ certain signs only so long as we require them for the sake of distinction new observations abstract some and add new ones so that an empirical conception never remains within permanent limits
it is in fact useless to define a conception of this kind
if for example we are speaking of water and its properties we do not stop at what we actually think by the word water but proceed to observation and experiment and the word with the few signs attached to it is more properly a designation than a conception of the thing
a definition in this case would evidently be nothing more than a determination of the word
in the second place no priori conception such as those of substance cause right fitness and so on can be defined
for i can never be sure that the clear representation of a given conception which is given in a confused state has been fully developed until i know that the representation is adequate with its object
but inasmuch as the conception as it is presented to the mind may contain a number of obscure representations which we do not observe in our analysis although we employ them in our application of the conception i can never be sure that my analysis is complete while examples may make this probable although they can never demonstrate the fact
instead of the word definition i should rather employ the term expositiona more modest expression which the critic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to the completeness of the analysis of any such conception
as therefore neither empirical nor priori conceptions are capable of definition we have to see whether the only other kind of conceptionsarbitrary conceptionscan be subjected to this mental operation
such a conception can always be defined for i must know thoroughly what i wished to cogitate in it as it was i who created it and it was not given to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by experience
at the same time i cannot say that by such a definition i have defined a real object
if the conception is based upon empirical conditions if for example i have a conception of a clock for a ship this arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or even of the possibility of the object
my definition of such a conception would with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than a definition of an object
there are no other conceptions which can bear definition except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis which can be constructed priori
consequently the science of mathematics alone possesses definitions
for the object here thought is presented priori in intuition and thus it can never contain more or less than the conception because the conception of the object has been given by the definitionand primarily that is without deriving the definition from any other source
philosophical definitions are therefore merely expositions of given conceptions while mathematical definitions are constructions of conceptions originally formed by the mind itself the former are produced by analysis the completeness of which is never demonstratively certain the latter by a synthesis
in a mathematical definition the conception is formed in a philosophical definition it is only explained
from this it follows
the definition must describe the conception completely that is omit none of the marks or signs of which it composed within its own limits that is it must be precise and enumerate no more signs than belong to the conception and on primary grounds that is to say the limitations of the bounds of the conception must not be deduced from other conceptions as in this case a proof would be necessary and the socalled definition would be incapable of taking its place at the head of all the judgements we have to form regarding an object
a that we must not imitate in philosophy the mathematical usage of commencing with definitionsexcept by way of hypothesis or experiment
for as all socalled philosophical definitions are merely analyses of given conceptions these conceptions although only in a confused form must precede the analysis and the incomplete exposition must precede the complete so that we may be able to draw certain inferences from the characteristics which an incomplete analysis has enabled us to discover before we attain to the complete exposition or definition of the conception
in one word a full and clear definition ought in philosophy rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of our labours
in mathematics on the contrary we cannot have a conception prior to the definition it is the definition which gives us the conception and it must for this reason form the commencement of every chain of mathematical reasoning
philosophy abounds in faulty definitions especially such as contain some of the elements requisite to form a complete definition
if a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been defined it would fare ill with all philosophical thought
but as incompletely defined conceptions may always be employed without detriment to truth so far as our analysis of the elements contained in them proceeds imperfect definitions that is propositions which are properly not definitions but merely approximations thereto may be used with great advantage
in mathematics definition belongs ad esse in philosophy ad melius esse
it is a difficult task to construct a proper definition
jurists are still without a complete definition of the idea of right
b mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous
for the conception is given only in and through the definition and thus it contains only what has been cogitated in the definition
but although a definition cannot be incorrect as regards its content an error may sometimes although seldom creep into the form
this error consists in a want of precision
thus the common definition of a circlethat it is a curved line every point in which is equally distant from another point called the centreis faulty from the fact that the determination indicated by the word curved is superfluous
for there ought to be a particular theorem which may be easily proved from the definition to the effect that every line which has all its points at equal distances from another point must be a curved linethat is that not even the smallest part of it can be straight
analytical definitions on the other hand may be erroneous in many respects either by the introduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception or by wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of a definition
in the latter case the definition is necessarily defective because we can never be fully certain of the completeness of our analysis
for these reasons the method of definition employed in mathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy
of axioms
these in so far as they are immediately certain are priori synthetical principles
now one conception cannot be connected synthetically and yet immediately with another because if we wish to proceed out of and beyond a conception a third mediating cognition is necessary
and as philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid of conceptions alone there is to be found in it no principle which deserves to be called an axiom
mathematics on the other hand may possess axioms because it can always connect the predicates of an object priori and without any mediating term by means of the construction of conceptions in intuition
such is the case with the proposition three points can always lie in a plane
on the other hand no synthetical principle which is based upon conceptions can ever be immediately certain for example the proposition everything that happens has a cause because i require a mediating term to connect the two conceptions of event and causenamely the condition of timedetermination in an experience and i cannot cognize any such principle immediately and from conceptions alone
discursive principles are accordingly very different from intuitive principles or axioms
the former always require deduction which in the case of the latter may be altogether dispensed with
axioms are for this reason always selfevident while philosophical principles whatever may be the degree of certainty they possess cannot lay any claim to such a distinction
no synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reason can be so evident as is often rashly enough declared as the statement twice two are four
it is true that in the analytic i introduced into the list of principles of the pure understanding certain axioms of intuition but the principle there discussed was not itself an axiom but served merely to present the principle of the possibility of axioms in general while it was really nothing more than a principle based upon conceptions
for it is one part of the duty of transcendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematics itself
philosophy possesses then no axioms and has no right to impose its priori principles upon thought until it has established their authority and validity by a thoroughgoing deduction
of demonstrations
only an apodeictic proof based upon intuition can be termed a demonstration
experience teaches us what is but it cannot convince us that it might not have been otherwise
hence a proof upon empirical grounds cannot be apodeictic
priori conceptions in discursive cognition can never produce intuitive certainty or evidence however certain the judgement they present may be
mathematics alone therefore contains demonstrations because it does not deduce its cognition from conceptions but from the construction of conceptions that is from intuition which can be given priori in accordance with conceptions
the method of algebra in equations from which the correct answer is deduced by reduction is a kind of constructionnot geometrical but by symbolsin which all conceptions especially those of the relations of quantities are represented in intuition by signs and thus the conclusions in that science are secured from errors by the fact that every proof is submitted to ocular evidence
philosophical cognition does not possess this advantage it being required to consider the general always in abstracto by means of conceptions while mathematics can always consider it in concreto in an individual intuition and at the same time by means of priori representation whereby all errors are rendered manifest to the senses
the formerdiscursive proofsought to be termed acroamatic proofs rather than demonstrations as only words are employed in them while demonstrations proper as the term itself indicates always require a reference to the intuition of the object
it follows from all these considerations that it is not consonant with the nature of philosophy especially in the sphere of pure reason to employ the dogmatical method and to adorn itself with the titles and insignia of mathematical science
it does not belong to that order and can only hope for a fraternal union with that science
its attempts at mathematical evidence are vain pretensions which can only keep it back from its true aim which is to detect the illusory procedure of reason when transgressing its proper limits and by fully explaining and analysing our conceptions to conduct us from the dim regions of speculation to the clear region of modest selfknowledge
reason must not therefore in its transcendental endeavours look forward with such confidence as if the path it is pursuing led straight to its aim nor reckon with such security upon its premisses as to consider it unnecessary to take a step back or to keep a strict watch for errors which overlooked in the principles may be detected in the arguments themselvesin which case it may be requisite either to determine these principles with greater strictness or to change them entirely
i divide all apodeictic propositions whether demonstrable or immediately certain into dogmata and mathemata
a direct synthetical proposition based on conceptions is a dogma a proposition of the same kind based on the construction of conceptions is a mathema
analytical judgements do not teach us any more about an object than what was contained in the conception we had of it because they do not extend our cognition beyond our conception of an object they merely elucidate the conception
they cannot therefore be with propriety termed dogmas
of the two kinds of priori synthetical propositions above mentioned only those which are employed in philosophy can according to the general mode of speech bear this name those of arithmetic or geometry would not be rightly so denominated
thus the customary mode of speaking confirms the explanation given above and the conclusion arrived at that only those judgements which are based upon conceptions not on the construction of conceptions can be termed dogmatical
thus pure reason in the sphere of speculation does not contain a single direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions
by means of ideas it is as we have shown incapable of producing synthetical judgements which are objectively valid by means of the conceptions of the understanding it establishes certain indubitable principles not however directly on the basis of conceptions but only indirectly by means of the relation of these conceptions to something of a purely contingent nature namely possible experience
when experience is presupposed these principles are apodeictically certain but in themselves and directly they cannot even be cognized priori
thus the given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient for the demonstration of the proposition every event has a cause
for this reason it is not a dogma although from another point of view that of experience it is capable of being proved to demonstration
the proper term for such a proposition is principle and not theorem although it does require to be proved because it possesses the remarkable peculiarity of being the condition of the possibility of its own ground of proof that is experience and of forming a necessary presupposition in all empirical observation
if then in the speculative sphere of pure reason no dogmata are to be found all dogmatical methods whether borrowed from mathematics or invented by philosophical thinkers are alike inappropriate and inefficient
they only serve to conceal errors and fallacies and to deceive philosophy whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safe and straight path
a philosophical method may however be systematical
for our reason is subjectively considered itself a system and in the sphere of mere conceptions a system of investigation according to principles of unity the material being supplied by experience alone
but this is not the proper place for discussing the peculiar method of transcendental philosophy as our present task is simply to examine whether our faculties are capable of erecting an edifice on the basis of pure reason and how far they may proceed with the materials at their command
section ii
the discipline of pure reason in polemics
reason must be subject in all its operations to criticism which must always be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint otherwise its interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious to suspicion
there is nothing however useful however sacred it may be that can claim exemption from the searching examination of this supreme tribunal which has no respect of persons
the very existence of reason depends upon this freedom for the voice of reason is not that of a dictatorial and despotic power it is rather like the vote of the citizens of a free state every member of which must have the privilege of giving free expression to his doubts and possess even the right of veto
but while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal of criticism it has not always cause to dread the judgement of this court
pure reason however when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism is not so thoroughly conscious of a strict observance of its highest laws as to appear before a higher judicial reason with perfect confidence
on the contrary it must renounce its magnificent dogmatical pretensions in philosophy
very different is the case when it has to defend itself not before a judge but against an equal
if dogmatical assertions are advanced on the negative side in opposition to those made by reason on the positive side its justification kat authrhopon is complete although the proof of its propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory
by the polemic of pure reason i mean the defence of its propositions made by reason in opposition to the dogmatical counterpropositions advanced by other parties
the question here is not whether its own statements may not also be false it merely regards the fact that reason proves that the opposite cannot be established with demonstrative certainty nor even asserted with a higher degree of probability
reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance for although she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them no one can prove that she is not the rightful possessor
it is a melancholy reflection that reason in its highest exercise falls into an antithetic and that the supreme tribunal for the settlement of differences should not be at union with itself
it is true that we had to discuss the question of an apparent antithetic but we found that it was based upon a misconception
in conformity with the common prejudice phenomena were regarded as things in themselves and thus an absolute completeness in their synthesis was required in the one mode or in the other it was shown to be impossible in both a demand entirely out of place in regard to phenomena
there was then no real selfcontradiction of reason in the propositions the series of phenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning and this series is absolutely and in itself without beginning
the two propositions are perfectly consistent with each other because phenomena as phenomena are in themselves nothing and consequently the hypothesis that they are things in themselves must lead to selfcontradictory inferences
but there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot be provided against and the dispute must remain unsettled
take for example the theistic proposition there is a supreme being and on the other hand the atheistic counterstatement there exists no supreme being or in psychology everything that thinks possesses the attribute of absolute and permanent unity which is utterly different from the transitory unity of material phenomena and the counterproposition the soul is not an immaterial unity and its nature is transitory like that of phenomena
the objects of these questions contain no heterogeneous or contradictory elements for they relate to things in themselves and not to phenomena
there would arise indeed a real contradiction if reason came forward with a statement on the negative side of these questions alone
as regards the criticism to which the grounds of proof on the affirmative side must be subjected it may be freely admitted without necessitating the surrender of the affirmative propositions which have at least the interest of reason in their favouran advantage which the opposite party cannot lay claim to
i cannot agree with the opinion of several admirable thinkerssulzer among the restthat in spite of the weakness of the arguments hitherto in use we may hope one day to see sufficient demonstrations of the two cardinal propositions of pure reasonthe existence of a supreme being and the immortality of the soul
i am certain on the contrary that this will never be the case
for on what ground can reason base such synthetical propositions which do not relate to the objects of experience and their internal possibility but it is also demonstratively certain that no one will ever be able to maintain the contrary with the least show of probability
for as he can attempt such a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason he is bound to prove that a supreme being and a thinking subject in the character of a pure intelligence are impossible
but where will he find the knowledge which can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to things which transcend the region of experience we may therefore rest assured that the opposite never will be demonstrated
we need not then have recourse to scholastic arguments we may always admit the truth of those propositions which are consistent with the speculative interests of reason in the sphere of experience and form moreover the only means of uniting the speculative with the practical interest
our opponent who must not be considered here as a critic solely we can be ready to meet with a non liquet which cannot fail to disconcert him while we cannot deny his right to a similar retort as we have on our side the advantage of the support of the subjective maxim of reason and can therefore look upon all his sophistical arguments with calm indifference
from this point of view there is properly no antithetic of pure reason
for the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the field of pure theology and psychology but on this ground there can appear no combatant whom we need to fear
ridicule and boasting can be his only weapons and these may be laughed at as mere childs play
this consideration restores to reason her courage for what source of confidence could be found if she whose vocation it is to destroy error were at variance with herself and without any reasonable hope of ever reaching a state of permanent repose
everything in nature is good for some purpose
even poisons are serviceable they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generated in our system and must always find a place in every complete pharmacopoeia
the objections raised against the fallacies and sophistries of speculative reason are objections given by the nature of this reason itself and must therefore have a destination and purpose which can only be for the good of humanity
for what purpose has providence raised many objects in which we have the deepest interest so far above us that we vainly try to cognize them with certainty and our powers of mental vision are rather excited than satisfied by the glimpses we may chance to seize it is very doubtful whether it is for our benefit to advance bold affirmations regarding subjects involved in such obscurity perhaps it would even be detrimental to our best interests
but it is undoubtedly always beneficial to leave the investigating as well as the critical reason in perfect freedom and permit it to take charge of its own interests which are advanced as much by its limitation as by its extension of its views and which always suffer by the interference of foreign powers forcing it against its natural tendencies to bend to certain preconceived designs
allow your opponent to say what he thinks reasonable and combat him only with the weapons of reason
have no anxiety for the practical interests of humanitythese are never imperilled in a purely speculative dispute
such a dispute serves merely to disclose the antinomy of reason which as it has its source in the nature of reason ought to be thoroughly investigated
reason is benefited by the examination of a subject on both sides and its judgements are corrected by being limited
it is not the matter that may give occasion to dispute but the manner
for it is perfectly permissible to employ in the presence of reason the language of a firmly rooted faith even after we have been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge
if we were to ask the dispassionate david humea philosopher endowed in a degree that few are with a wellbalanced judgement what motive induced you to spend so much labour and thought in undermining the consoling and beneficial persuasion that reason is capable of assuring us of the existence and presenting us with a determinate conception of a supreme beinghis answer would be nothing but the desire of teaching reason to know its own powers better and at the same time a dislike of the procedure by which that faculty was compelled to support foregone conclusions and prevented from confessing the internal weaknesses which it cannot but feel when it enters upon a rigid selfexamination
if on the other hand we were to ask priestleya philosopher who had no taste for transcendental speculation but was entirely devoted to the principles of empiricismwhat his motives were for overturning those two main pillars of religionthe doctrines of the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul in his view the hope of a future life is but the expectation of the miracle of resurrectionthis philosopher himself a zealous and pious teacher of religion could give no other answer than this i acted in the interest of reason which always suffers when certain objects are explained and judged by a reference to other supposed laws than those of material naturethe only laws which we know in a determinate manner
it would be unfair to decry the latter philosopher who endeavoured to harmonize his paradoxical opinions with the interests of religion and to undervalue an honest and reflecting man because he finds himself at a loss the moment he has left the field of natural science
the same grace must be accorded to hume a man not less welldisposed and quite as blameless in his moral character and who pushed his abstract speculations to an extreme length because as he rightly believed the object of them lies entirely beyond the bounds of natural science and within the sphere of pure ideas
what is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in the present case to menace the best interests of humanity the course to be pursued in reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and natural one
let each thinker pursue his own path if he shows talent if he gives evidence of profound thought in one word if he shows that he possesses the power of reasoningreason is always the gainer
if you have recourse to other means if you attempt to coerce reason if you raise the cry of treason to humanity if you excite the feelings of the crowd which can neither understand nor sympathize with such subtle speculationsyou will only make yourselves ridiculous
for the question does not concern the advantage or disadvantage which we are expected to reap from such inquiries the question is merely how far reason can advance in the field of speculation apart from all kinds of interest and whether we may depend upon the exertions of speculative reason or must renounce all reliance on it
instead of joining the combatants it is your part to be a tranquil spectator of the strugglea laborious struggle for the parties engaged but attended in its progress as well as in its result with the most advantageous consequences for the interests of thought and knowledge
it is absurd to expect to be enlightened by reason and at the same time to prescribe to her what side of the question she must adopt
moreover reason is sufficiently held in check by its own power the limits imposed on it by its own nature are sufficient it is unnecessary for you to place over it additional guards as if its power were dangerous to the constitution of the intellectual state
in the dialectic of reason there is no victory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility
the strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason and we cannot but wish that it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedom which ought to be its essential condition
in this case we should have had at an earlier period a matured and profound criticism which must have put an end to all dialectical disputes by exposing the illusions and prejudices in which they originated
there is in human nature an unworthy propensitya propensity which like everything that springs from nature must in its final purpose be conducive to the good of humanityto conceal our real sentiments and to give expression only to certain received opinions which are regarded as at once safe and promotive of the common good
it is true this tendency not only to conceal our real sentiments but to profess those which may gain us favour in the eyes of society has not only civilized but in a certain measure moralized us as no one can break through the outward covering of respectability honour and morality and thus the seeminglygood examples which we see around us form an excellent school for moral improvement so long as our belief in their genuineness remains unshaken
but this disposition to represent ourselves as better than we are and to utter opinions which are not our own can be nothing more than a kind of provisionary arrangement of nature to lead us from the rudeness of an uncivilized state and to teach us how to assume at least the appearance and manner of the good we see
but when true principles have been developed and have obtained a sure foundation in our habit of thought this conventionalism must be attacked with earnest vigour otherwise it corrupts the heart and checks the growth of good dispositions with the mischievous weed of fair appearances
i am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation and hypocrisy in the sphere of speculative discussion where there is less temptation to restrain the free expression of thought
for what can be more prejudicial to the interests of intelligence than to falsify our real sentiments to conceal the doubts which we feel in regard to our statements or to maintain the validity of grounds of proof which we well know to be insufficient so long as mere personal vanity is the source of these unworthy artificesand this is generally the case in speculative discussions which are mostly destitute of practical interest and are incapable of complete demonstrationthe vanity of the opposite party exaggerates as much on the other side and thus the result is the same although it is not brought about so soon as if the dispute had been conducted in a sincere and upright spirit
but where the mass entertains the notion that the aim of certain subtle speculators is nothing less than to shake the very foundations of public welfare and moralityit seems not only prudent but even praise worthy to maintain the good cause by illusory arguments rather than to give to our supposed opponents the advantage of lowering our declarations to the moderate tone of a merely practical conviction and of compelling us to confess our inability to attain to apodeictic certainty in speculative subjects
but we ought to reflect that there is nothing in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good cause than deceit misrepresentation and falsehood
that the strictest laws of honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculative subject is the least requirement that can be made
if we could reckon with security even upon so little the conflict of speculative reason regarding the important questions of god immortality and freedom would have been either decided long ago or would very soon be brought to a conclusion
but in general the uprightness of the defence stands in an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause and perhaps more honesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than by those who uphold these doctrines
i shall persuade myself then that i have readers who do not wish to see a righteous cause defended by unfair arguments
such will now recognize the fact that according to the principles of this critique if we consider not what is but what ought to be the case there can be really no polemic of pure reason
for how can two persons dispute about a thing the reality of which neither can present in actual or even in possible experience each adopts the plan of meditating on his idea for the purpose of drawing from the idea if he can what is more than the idea that is the reality of the object which it indicates
how shall they settle the dispute since neither is able to make his assertions directly comprehensible and certain but must restrict himself to attacking and confuting those of his opponent all statements enounced by pure reason transcend the conditions of possible experience beyond the sphere of which we can discover no criterion of truth while they are at the same time framed in accordance with the laws of the understanding which are applicable only to experience and thus it is the fate of all such speculative discussions that while the one party attacks the weaker side of his opponent he infallibly lays open his own weaknesses
the critique of pure reason may be regarded as the highest tribunal for all speculative disputes for it is not involved in these disputes which have an immediate relation to certain objects and not to the laws of the mind but is instituted for the purpose of determining the rights and limits of reason
without the control of criticism reason is as it were in a state of nature and can only establish its claims and assertions by war
criticism on the contrary deciding all questions according to the fundamental laws of its own institution secures to us the peace of law and order and enables us to discuss all differences in the more tranquil manner of a legal process
in the former case disputes are ended by victory which both sides may claim and which is followed by a hollow armistice in the latter by a sentence which as it strikes at the root of all speculative differences ensures to all concerned a lasting peace
the endless disputes of a dogmatizing reason compel us to look for some mode of arriving at a settled decision by a critical investigation of reason itself just as hobbes maintains that the state of nature is a state of injustice and violence and that we must leave it and submit ourselves to the constraint of law which indeed limits individual freedom but only that it may consist with the freedom of others and with the common good of all
this freedom will among other things permit of our openly stating the difficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve without being decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens
this privilege forms part of the native rights of human reason which recognizes no other judge than the universal reason of humanity and as this reason is the source of all progress and improvement such a privilege is to be held sacred and inviolable
it is unwise moreover to denounce as dangerous any bold assertions against or rash attacks upon an opinion which is held by the largest and most moral class of the community for that would be giving them an importance which they do not deserve
when i hear that the freedom of the will the hope of a future life and the existence of god have been overthrown by the arguments of some able writer i feel a strong desire to read his book for i expect that he will add to my knowledge and impart greater clearness and distinctness to my views by the argumentative power shown in his writings
but i am perfectly certain even before i have opened the book that he has not succeeded in a single point not because i believe i am in possession of irrefutable demonstrations of these important propositions but because this transcendental critique which has disclosed to me the power and the limits of pure reason has fully convinced me that as it is insufficient to establish the affirmative it is as powerless and even more so to assure us of the truth of the negative answer to these questions
from what source does this freethinker derive his knowledge that there is for example no supreme being this proposition lies out of the field of possible experience and therefore beyond the limits of human cognition
but i would not read at all the answer which the dogmatical maintainer of the good cause makes to his opponent because i know well beforehand that he will merely attack the fallacious grounds of his adversary without being able to establish his own assertions
besides a new illusory argument in the construction of which talent and acuteness are shown is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning and in this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless
again the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment to criticism and enables us to test and correct its principles while there is no occasion for anxiety in regard to the influence and results of his reasoning
but it will be said must we not warn the youth entrusted to academical care against such writings must we not preserve them from the knowledge of these dangerous assertions until their judgement is ripened or rather until the doctrines which we wish to inculcate are so firmly rooted in their minds as to withstand all attempts at instilling the contrary dogmas from whatever quarter they may come
if we are to confine ourselves to the dogmatical procedure in the sphere of pure reason and find ourselves unable to settle such disputes otherwise than by becoming a party in them and setting counterassertions against the statements advanced by our opponents there is certainly no plan more advisable for the moment but at the same time none more absurd and inefficient for the future than this retaining of the youthful mind under guardianship for a time and thus preserving itfor so long at leastfrom seduction into error
but when at a later period either curiosity or the prevalent fashion of thought places such writings in their hands will the socalled convictions of their youth stand firm the young thinker who has in his armoury none but dogmatical weapons with which to resist the attacks of his opponent and who cannot detect the latent dialectic which lies in his own opinions as well as in those of the opposite party sees the advance of illusory arguments and grounds of proof which have the advantage of novelty against as illusory grounds of proof destitute of this advantage and which perhaps excite the suspicion that the natural credulity of his youth has been abused by his instructors
he thinks he can find no better means of showing that he has out grown the discipline of his minority than by despising those wellmeant warnings and knowing no system of thought but that of dogmatism he drinks deep draughts of the poison that is to sap the principles in which his early years were trained
exactly the opposite of the system here recommended ought to be pursued in academical instruction
this can only be effected however by a thorough training in the critical investigation of pure reason
for in order to bring the principles of this critique into exercise as soon as possible and to demonstrate their perfect even in the presence of the highest degree of dialectical illusion the student ought to examine the assertions made on both sides of speculative questions step by step and to test them by these principles
it cannot be a difficult task for him to show the fallacies inherent in these propositions and thus he begins early to feel his own power of securing himself against the influence of such sophistical arguments which must finally lose for him all their illusory power
and although the same blows which overturn the edifice of his opponent are as fatal to his own speculative structures if such he has wished to rear he need not feel any sorrow in regard to this seeming misfortune as he has now before him a fair prospect into the practical region in which he may reasonably hope to find a more secure foundation for a rational system
there is accordingly no proper polemic in the sphere of pure reason
both parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows as they pass beyond the limits of nature and can find no tangible point of attackno firm footing for their dogmatical conflict
fight as vigorously as they may the shadows which they hew down immediately start up again like the heroes in walhalla and renew the bloodless and unceasing contest
but neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employment of pure reason such as might be based upon the principle of neutrality in all speculative disputes
to excite reason against itself to place weapons in the hands of the party on the one side as well as in those of the other and to remain an undisturbed and sarcastic spectator of the fierce struggle that ensues seems from the dogmatical point of view to be a part fitting only a malevolent disposition
but when the sophist evidences an invincible obstinacy and blindness and a pride which no criticism can moderate there is no other practicable course than to oppose to this pride and obstinacy similar feelings and pretensions on the other side equally well or ill founded so that reason staggered by the reflections thus forced upon it finds it necessary to moderate its confidence in such pretensions and to listen to the advice of criticism
but we cannot stop at these doubts much less regard the conviction of our ignorance not only as a cure for the conceit natural to dogmatism but as the settlement of the disputes in which reason is involved with itself
on the contrary scepticism is merely a means of awakening reason from its dogmatic dreams and exciting it to a more careful investigation into its own powers and pretensions
but as scepticism appears to be the shortest road to a permanent peace in the domain of philosophy and as it is the track pursued by the many who aim at giving a philosophical colouring to their contemptuous dislike of all inquiries of this kind i think it necessary to present to my readers this mode of thought in its true light
scepticism not a permanent state for human reason
the consciousness of ignoranceunless this ignorance is recognized to be absolutely necessary ought instead of forming the conclusion of my inquiries to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them
all ignorance is either ignorance of things or of the limits of knowledge
if my ignorance is accidental and not necessary it must incite me in the first case to a dogmatical inquiry regarding the objects of which i am ignorant in the second to a critical investigation into the bounds of all possible knowledge
but that my ignorance is absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that it consequently absolves from the duty of all further investigation is a fact which cannot be made out upon empirical groundsfrom observationbut upon critical grounds alone that is by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primary sources of cognition
it follows that the determination of the bounds of reason can be made only on priori grounds while the empirical limitation of reason which is merely an indeterminate cognition of an ignorance that can never be completely removed can take place only posteriori
in other words our empirical knowledge is limited by that which yet remains for us to know
the former cognition of our ignorance which is possible only on a rational basis is a science the latter is merely a perception and we cannot say how far the inferences drawn from it may extend
if i regard the earth as it really appears to my senses as a flat surface i am ignorant how far this surface extends
but experience teaches me that how far soever i go i always see before me a space in which i can proceed farther and thus i know the limitsmerely visualof my actual knowledge of the earth although i am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself
but if i have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere and that its surface is spherical i can cognize priori and determine upon principles from my knowledge of a small part of this surfacesay to the extent of a degreethe diameter and circumference of the earth and although i am ignorant of the objects which this surface contains i have a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent
the sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be a level surface with an apparent horizonthat which forms the limit of its extent and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned totality
to reach this limit by empirical means is impossible and all attempts to determine it priori according to a principle are alike in vain
but all the questions raised by pure reason relate to that which lies beyond this horizon or at least in its boundary line
the celebrated david hume was one of those geographers of human reason who believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all such questions by declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of our knowledgea horizon which however hume was unable to determine
his attention especially was directed to the principle of causality and he remarked with perfect justice that the truth of this principle and even the objective validity of the conception of a cause was not commonly based upon clear insight that is upon priori cognition
hence he concluded that this law does not derive its authority from its universality and necessity but merely from its general applicability in the course of experience and a kind of subjective necessity thence arising which he termed habit
from the inability of reason to establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all experience he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to pass the region of the empirical
this procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination and if necessary to disapproval may be termed the censura of reason
this censura must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendent employment of principles
but this is only the second step in our inquiry
the first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason and which marks the infancy of that faculty is that of dogmatism
the second which we have just mentioned is that of scepticism and it gives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience
but a third step is necessaryindicative of the maturity and manhood of the judgement which now lays a firm foundation upon universal and necessary principles
this is the period of criticism in which we do not examine the facta of reason but reason itself in the whole extent of its powers and in regard to its capability of priori cognition and thus we determine not merely the empirical and evershifting bounds of our knowledge but its necessary and eternal limits
we demonstrate from indubitable principles not merely our ignorance in respect to this or that subject but in regard to all possible questions of a certain class
thus scepticism is a resting place for reason in which it may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings and gain some knowledge of the region in which it happens to be that it may pursue its way with greater certainty but it cannot be its permanent dwellingplace
it must take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves or to the limits which bound all our cognition
reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane of the bounds of which we have only a general knowledge it ought rather to be compared to a sphere the radius of which may be found from the curvature of its surfacethat is the nature of priori synthetical propositionsand consequently its circumference and extent
beyond the sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize nay even questions regarding such supposititious objects relate only to the subjective principles of a complete determination of the relations which exist between the understandingconceptions which lie within this sphere
we are actually in possession of priori synthetical cognitions as is proved by the existence of the principles of the understanding which anticipate experience
if any one cannot comprehend the possibility of these principles he may have some reason to doubt whether they are really priori but he cannot on this account declare them to be impossible and affirm the nullity of the steps which reason may have taken under their guidance
he can only say if we perceived their origin and their authenticity we should be able to determine the extent and limits of reason but till we can do this all propositions regarding the latter are mere random assertions
in this view the doubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy which proceeds without the guidance of criticism is well grounded but we cannot therefore deny to reason the ability to construct a sound philosophy when the way has been prepared by a thorough critical investigation
all the conceptions produced and all the questions raised by pure reason do not lie in the sphere of experience but in that of reason itself and hence they must be solved and shown to be either valid or inadmissible by that faculty
we have no right to decline the solution of such problems on the ground that the solution can be discovered only from the nature of things and under pretence of the limitation of human faculties for reason is the sole creator of all these ideas and is therefore bound either to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature
the polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist who erects a system of philosophy without having examined the fundamental objective principles on which it is based for the purpose of evidencing the futility of his designs and thus bringing him to a knowledge of his own powers
but in itself scepticism does not give us any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge
all unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia which it is always useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic
but this cannot help us to any decision regarding the expectations which reason cherishes of better success in future endeavours the investigations of scepticism cannot therefore settle the dispute regarding the rights and powers of human reason
hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical philosophers and his writings have undoubtedly exerted the most powerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation into its own powers
it will therefore well repay our labours to consider for a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errors into which he strayed although setting out on the path of truth and certitude
hume was probably aware although he never clearly developed the notion that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our conception of the object
i have termed this kind of judgement synthetical
as regard the manner in which i pass beyond my conception by the aid of experience no doubts can be entertained
experience is itself a synthesis of perceptions and it employs perceptions to increment the conception which i obtain by means of another perception
but we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a conception and to extend our cognition priori
we attempt this in two wayseither through the pure understanding in relation to that which may become an object of experience or through pure reason in relation to such properties of things or of the existence of things as can never be presented in any experience
this sceptical philosopher did not distinguish these two kinds of judgements as he ought to have done but regarded this augmentation of conceptions and if we may so express ourselves the spontaneous generation of understanding and reason independently of the impregnation of experience as altogether impossible
the socalled priori principles of these faculties he consequently held to be invalid and imaginary and regarded them as nothing but subjective habits of thought originating in experience and therefore purely empirical and contingent rules to which we attribute a spurious necessity and universality
in support of this strange assertion he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of the relation between cause and effect
no faculty of the mind can conduct us from the conception of a thing to the existence of something else and hence he believed he could infer that without experience we possess no source from which we can augment a conception and no ground sufficient to justify us in framing a judgement that is to extend our cognition priori
that the light of the sun which shines upon a piece of wax at the same time melts it while it hardens clay no power of the understanding could infer from the conceptions which we previously possessed of these substances much less is there any priori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion which experience alone can certify
on the other hand we have seen in our discussion of transcendental logic that although we can never proceed immediately beyond the content of the conception which is given us we can always cognize completely prioriin relation however to a third term namely possible experiencethe law of its connection with other things
for example if i observe that a piece of wax melts i can cognize priori that there must have been something the suns heat preceding which this law although without the aid of experience i could not cognize priori and in a determinate manner either the cause from the effect or the effect from the cause
hume was therefore wrong in inferring from the contingency of the determination according to law the contingency of the law itself and the passing beyond the conception of a thing to possible experience which is an priori proceeding constituting the objective reality of the conception he confounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience which is always of course empirical
thus too he regarded the principle of affinity which has its seat in the understanding and indicates a necessary connection as a mere rule of association lying in the imitative faculty of imagination which can present only contingent and not objective connections
the sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principally from a defect which was common to him with the dogmatists namely that he had never made a systematic review of all the different kinds of priori synthesis performed by the understanding
had he done so he would have found to take one example among many that the principle of permanence was of this character and that it as well as the principle of causality anticipates experience
in this way he might have been able to describe the determinate limits of the priori operations of understanding and reason
but he merely declared the understanding to be limited instead of showing what its limits were he created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties without giving us any determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary and unavoidable ignorance he examined and condemned some of the principles of the understanding without investigating all its powers with the completeness necessary to criticism
he denies with truth certain powers to the understanding but he goes further and declares it to be utterly inadequate to the priori extension of knowledge although he has not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty and thus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too
that is to say his own declarations are doubted for his objections were based upon facta which are contingent and not upon principles which can alone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical assertions
as hume makes no distinction between the wellgrounded claims of the understanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason against which however his attacks are mainly directed reason does not feel itself shut out from all attempts at the extension of priori cognition and hence it refuses in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter to relinquish such efforts
for one naturally arms oneself to resist an attack and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish the claims he has advanced
but a complete review of the powers of reason and the conviction thence arising that we are in possession of a limited field of action while we must admit the vanity of higher claims puts an end to all doubt and dispute and induces reason to rest satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain
to the uncritical dogmatist who has not surveyed the sphere of his understanding nor determined in accordance with principles the limits of possible cognition who consequently is ignorant of his own powers and believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes in the field of cognition these attacks of scepticism are not only dangerous but destructive
for if there is one proposition in his chain of reasoning which he cannot prove or the fallacy in which he cannot evolve in accordance with a principle suspicion falls on all his statements however plausible they may appear
and thus scepticism the bane of dogmatical philosophy conducts us to a sound investigation into the understanding and the reason
when we are thus far advanced we need fear no further attacks for the limits of our domain are clearly marked out and we can make no claims nor become involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond these limits
thus the sceptical procedure in philosophy does not present any solution of the problems of reason but it forms an excellent exercise for its powers awakening its circumspection and indicating the means whereby it may most fully establish its claims to its legitimate possessions
section iii
the discipline of pure reason in hypothesis
this critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to extend the bounds of knowledge by means of pure speculation are utterly fruitless
so much the wider field it may appear lies open to hypothesis as where we cannot know with certainty we are at liberty to make guesses and to form suppositions
imagination may be allowed under the strict surveillance of reason to invent suppositions but these must be based on something that is perfectly certainand that is the possibility of the object
if we are well assured upon this point it is allowable to have recourse to supposition in regard to the reality of the object but this supposition must unless it is utterly groundless be connected as its ground of explanation with that which is really given and absolutely certain
such a supposition is termed a hypothesis
it is beyond our power to form the least conception priori of the possibility of dynamical connection in phenomena and the category of the pure understanding will not enable us to excogitate any such connection but merely helps us to understand it when we meet with it in experience
for this reason we cannot in accordance with the categories imagine or invent any object or any property of an object not given or that may not be given in experience and employ it in a hypothesis otherwise we should be basing our chain of reasoning upon mere chimerical fancies and not upon conceptions of things
thus we have no right to assume the existence of new powers not existing in naturefor example an understanding with a nonsensuous intuition a force of attraction without contact or some new kind of substances occupying space and yet without the property of impenetrabilityand consequently we cannot assume that there is any other kind of community among substances than that observable in experience any kind of presence than that in space or any kind of duration than that in time
in one word the conditions of possible experience are for reason the only conditions of the possibility of things reason cannot venture to form independently of these conditions any conceptions of things because such conceptions although not selfcontradictory are without object and without application
the conceptions of reason are as we have already shown mere ideas and do not relate to any object in any kind of experience
at the same time they do not indicate imaginary or possible objects
they are purely problematical in their nature and as aids to the heuristic exercise of the faculties form the basis of the regulative principles for the systematic employment of the understanding in the field of experience
if we leave this ground of experience they become mere fictions of thought the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable and they cannot consequently be employed as hypotheses in the explanation of real phenomena
it is quite admissible to cogitate the soul as simple for the purpose of enabling ourselves to employ the idea of a perfect and necessary unity of all the faculties of the mind as the principle of all our inquiries into its internal phenomena although we cannot cognize this unity in concreto
but to assume that the soul is a simple substance a transcendental conception would be enouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrableas many physical hypotheses arebut a proposition which is purely arbitrary and in the highest degree rash
the simple is never presented in experience and if by substance is here meant the permanent object of sensuous intuition the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly inconceivable
reason affords no good grounds for admitting the existence of intelligible beings or of intelligible properties of sensuous things althoughas we have no conception either of their possibility or of their impossibilityit will always be out of our power to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist
in the explanation of given phenomena no other things and no other grounds of explanation can be employed than those which stand in connection with the given phenomena according to the known laws of experience
a transcendental hypothesis in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain the phenomena of nature would not give us any better insight into a phenomenon as we should be trying to explain what we do not sufficiently understand from known empirical principles by what we do not understand at all
the principles of such a hypothesis might conduce to the satisfaction of reason but it would not assist the understanding in its application to objects
order and conformity to aims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon natural grounds and according to natural laws and the wildest hypotheses if they are only physical are here more admissible than a hyperphysical hypothesis such as that of a divine author
for such a hypothesis would introduce the principle of ignava ratio which requires us to give up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course of experience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea
as regards the absolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of these causes this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case of phenomena because as they are to us nothing more than phenomena we have no right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesis of the series of their conditions
transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible and we cannot use the liberty of employing in the absence of physical hyperphysical grounds of explanation
and this for two reasons first because such hypothesis do not advance reason but rather stop it in its progress secondly because this licence would render fruitless all its exertions in its own proper sphere which is that of experience
for when the explanation of natural phenomena happens to be difficult we have constantly at hand a transcendental ground of explanation which lifts us above the necessity of investigating nature and our inquiries are brought to a close not because we have obtained all the requisite knowledge but because we abut upon a principle which is incomprehensible and which indeed is so far back in the track of thought as to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being
the next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is its sufficiency
that is it must determine priori the consequences which are given in experience and which are supposed to follow from the hypothesis itself
if we require to employ auxiliary hypotheses the suspicion naturally arises that they are mere fictions because the necessity for each of them requires the same justification as in the case of the original hypothesis and thus their testimony is invalid
if we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect cause we possess sufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to aims the order and the greatness which we observe in the universe but we find ourselves obliged when we observe the evil in the world and the exceptions to these laws to employ new hypothesis in support of the original one
we employ the idea of the simple nature of the human soul as the foundation of all the theories we may form of its phenomena but when we meet with difficulties in our way when we observe in the soul phenomena similar to the changes which take place in matter we require to call in new auxiliary hypotheses
these may indeed not be false but we do not know them to be true because the only witness to their certitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called in to explain
we are not discussing the abovementioned assertions regarding the immaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a supreme being as dogmata which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate priori but purely as hypotheses
in the former case the dogmatist must take care that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of a demonstration
for the assertion that the reality of such ideas is probable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition in geometry
pure abstract reason apart from all experience can either cognize nothing at all and hence the judgements it enounces are never mere opinions they are either apodeictic certainties or declarations that nothing can be known on the subject
opinions and probable judgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explain given phenomena or they may relate to the effect in accordance with empirical laws of an actually existing cause
in other words we must restrict the sphere of opinion to the world of experience and nature
beyond this region opinion is mere invention unless we are groping about for the truth on a path not yet fully known and have some hopes of stumbling upon it by chance
but although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions of pure speculative reason they may be employed in the defence of these answers
that is to say hypotheses are admissible in polemic but not in the sphere of dogmatism
by the defence of statements of this character i do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds for their support but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents
all priori synthetical propositions possess the peculiarity that although the philosopher who maintains the reality of the ideas contained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficient knowledge to establish the certainty of his statements his opponent is as little able to prove the truth of the opposite
this equality of fortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in the sphere of speculative cognition and it is this sphere accordingly that is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts
but we shall afterwards show that in relation to its practical exercise reason has the right of admitting what in the field of pure speculation she would not be justified in supposing except upon perfectly sufficient grounds because all such suppositions destroy the necessary completeness of speculationa condition which the practical reason however does not consider to be requisite
in this sphere therefore reason is mistress of a possession her title to which she does not require to provewhich in fact she could not do
the burden of proof accordingly rests upon the opponent
but as he has just as little knowledge regarding the subject discussed and is as little able to prove the nonexistence of the object of an idea as the philosopher on the other side is to demonstrate its reality it is evident that there is an advantage on the side of the philosopher who maintains his proposition as a practically necessary supposition melior est conditio possidentis
for he is at liberty to employ in selfdefence the same weapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking him that is he has a right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of supporting the arguments in favour of his own propositions but to show that his opponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject under discussion and cannot boast of any speculative advantage
hypotheses are therefore admissible in the sphere of pure reason only as weapons for selfdefence and not as supports to dogmatical assertions
but the opposing party we must always seek for in ourselves
for speculative reason is in the sphere of transcendentalism dialectical in its own nature
the difficulties and objections we have to fear lie in ourselves
they are like old but never superannuated claims and we must seek them out and settle them once and for ever if we are to expect a permanent peace
external tranquility is hollow and unreal
the root of these contradictions which lies in the nature of human reason must be destroyed and this can only be done by giving it in the first instance freedom to grow nay by nourishing it that it may send out shoots and thus betray its own existence
it is our duty therefore to try to discover new objections to put weapons in the bands of our opponent and to grant him the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish
we have nothing to fear from these concessions on the contrary we may rather hope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no one will ever venture to dispute
the thinker requires to be fully equipped the hypotheses of pure reason which although but leaden weapons for they have not been steeled in the armoury of experience are as useful as any that can be employed by his opponents
if accordingly we have assumed from a nonspeculative point of view the immaterial nature of the soul and are met by the objection that experience seems to prove that the growth and decay of our mental faculties are mere modifications of the sensuous organismwe can weaken the force of this objection by the assumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental phenomenon to which as a necessary condition all sensibility and consequently all thought relates in the present state of our existence and that the separation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuous exercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of the intellectual
the body would in this view of the question be regarded not as the cause of thought but merely as its restrictive condition as promotive of the sensuous and animal but as a hindrance to the pure and spiritual life and the dependence of the animal life on the constitution of the body would not prove that the whole life of man was also dependent on the state of the organism
we might go still farther and discover new objections or carry out to their extreme consequences those which have already been adduced
generation in the human race as well as among the irrational animals depends on so many accidentsof occasion of proper sustenance of the laws enacted by the government of a country of vice even that it is difficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has begun under circumstances so mean and trivial and so entirely dependent upon our own control
as regards the continuance of the existence of the whole race we need have no difficulties for accident in single cases is subject to general laws but in the case of each individual it would seem as if we could hardly expect so wonderful an effect from causes so insignificant
but in answer to these objections we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life is properly intelligible and not subject to changes of time and that it neither began in birth nor will end in death
we may assume that this life is nothing more than a sensuous representation of pure spiritual life that the whole world of sense is but an image hovering before the faculty of cognition which we exercise in this sphere and with no more objective reality than a dream and that if we could intuite ourselves and other things as they really are we should see ourselves in a world of spiritual natures our connection with which did not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction of the body
and so on
we cannot be said to know what has been above asserted nor do we seriously maintain the truth of these assertions and the notions therein indicated are not even ideas of reason they are purely fictitious conceptions
but this hypothetical procedure is in perfect conformity with the laws of reason
our opponent mistakes the absence of empirical conditions for a proof of the complete impossibility of all that we have asserted and we have to show him that he has not exhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as little compass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature as we can lay a secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region of experience
such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an opponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion
the philosopher abandons them so soon as the opposite party renounces its dogmatical conceit
to maintain a simply negative position in relation to propositions which rest on an insecure foundation well befits the moderation of a true philosopher but to uphold the objections urged against an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a proceeding just as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position of a philosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such a subject
it is evident therefore that hypotheses in the speculative sphere are valid not as independent propositions but only relatively to opposite transcendent assumptions
for to make the principles of possible experience conditions of the possibility of things in general is just as transcendent a procedure as to maintain the objective reality of ideas which can be applied to no objects except such as lie without the limits of possible experience
the judgements enounced by pure reason must be necessary or they must not be enounced at all
reason cannot trouble herself with opinions
but the hypotheses we have been discussing are merely problematical judgements which can neither be confuted nor proved while therefore they are not personal opinions they are indispensable as answers to objections which are liable to be raised
but we must take care to confine them to this function and guard against any assumption on their part of absolute validity a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricable difficulties and contradictions
section iv
the discipline of pure reason in relation to proofs
it is a peculiarity which distinguishes the proofs of transcendental synthetical propositions from those of all other priori synthetical cognitions that reason in the case of the former does not apply its conceptions directly to an object but is first obliged to prove priori the objective validity of these conceptions and the possibility of their syntheses
this is not merely a prudential rule it is essential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendental proposition
if i am required to pass priori beyond the conception of an object i find that it is utterly impossible without the guidance of something which is not contained in the conception
in mathematics it is priori intuition that guides my synthesis and in this case all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition
in transcendental cognition so long as we are dealing only with conceptions of the understanding we are guided by possible experience
that is to say a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition does not show that the given conception that of an event for example leads directly to another conception that of a causefor this would be a saltus which nothing can justify but it shows that experience itself and consequently the object of experience is impossible without the connection indicated by these conceptions
it follows that such a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving synthetically and priori at a certain knowledge of things which was not contained in our conceptions of these things
unless we pay particular attention to this requirement our proofs instead of pursuing the straight path indicated by reason follow the tortuous road of mere subjective association
the illusory conviction which rests upon subjective causes of association and which is considered as resulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity is always open to doubt and suspicion
for this reason all the attempts which have been made to prove the principle of sufficient reason have according to the universal admission of philosophers been quite unsuccessful and before the appearance of transcendental criticism it was considered better as this principle could not be abandoned to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind a proceeding which always proves that the problem which reason ought to solve is one in which philosophers find great difficulties rather than attempt to discover new dogmatical proofs
but if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason and if i aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid of mere ideas it is necessary that the proof should first show that such a step in synthesis is possible which it is not before it proceeds to prove the truth of the proposition itself
the socalled proof of the simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception is a very plausible one
but it contains no answer to the objection that as the notion of absolute simplicity is not a conception which is directly applicable to a perception but is an idea which must be inferredif at allfrom observation it is by no means evident how the mere fact of consciousness which is contained in all thought although in so far a simple representation can conduct me to the consciousness and cognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance
when i represent to my mind the power of my body as in motion my body in this thought is so far absolute unity and my representation of it is a simple one and hence i can indicate this representation by the motion of a point because i have made abstraction of the size or volume of the body
but i cannot hence infer that given merely the moving power of a body the body may be cogitated as simple substance merely because the representation in my mind takes no account of its content in space and is consequently simple
the simple in abstraction is very different from the objectively simple and hence the ego which is simple in the first sense may in the second sense as indicating the soul itself be a very complex conception with a very various content
thus it is evident that in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism
we guess for without some such surmise our suspicion would not be excited in reference to a proof of this character at the presence of the paralogism by keeping ever before us a criterion of the possibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at proving more than experience can teach us
this criterion is obtained from the observation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subject of the proposition to be proved to the required predicate but find it necessary to presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition priori by means of ideas
we must accordingly always use the greatest caution we require before attempting any proof to consider how it is possible to extend the sphere of cognition by the operations of pure reason and from what source we are to derive knowledge which is not obtained from the analysis of conceptions nor relates by anticipation to possible experience
we shall thus spare ourselves much severe and fruitless labour by not expecting from reason what is beyond its power or rather by subjecting it to discipline and teaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of the sphere of cognition
the first rule for our guidance is therefore not to attempt a transcendental proof before we have considered from what source we are to derive the principles upon which the proof is to be based and what right we have to expect that our conclusions from these principles will be veracious
if they are principles of the understanding it is vain to expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason for these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possible experience
if they are principles of pure reason our labour is alike in vain
for the principles of reason if employed as objective are without exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth except as regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason in experience
but when such delusive proof are presented to us it is our duty to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement and although we are unable to expose the particular sophism upon which the proof is based we have a right to demand a deduction of the principles employed in it and if these principles have their origin in pure reason alone such a deduction is absolutely impossible
and thus it is unnecessary that we should trouble ourselves with the exposure and confutation of every sophistical illusion we may at once bring all dialectic which is inexhaustible in the production of fallacies before the bar of critical reason which tests the principles upon which all dialectical procedure is based
the second peculiarity of transcendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest upon more than a single proof
if i am drawing conclusions not from conceptions but from intuition corresponding to a conception be it pure intuition as in mathematics or empirical as in natural science the intuition which forms the basis of my inferences presents me with materials for many synthetical propositions which i can connect in various modes while as it is allowable to proceed from different points in the intention i can arrive by different paths at the same proposition
but every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception and posits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an object according to this conception
there must therefore be but one ground of proof because it is the conception alone which determines the object and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than the determination of the object according to the conception
in our transcendental analytic for example we inferred the principle every event has a cause from the only condition of the objective possibility of our conception of an event
this is that an event cannot be determined in time and consequently cannot form a part of experience unless it stands under this dynamical law
this is the only possible ground of proof for our conception of an event possesses objective validity that is is a true conception only because the law of causality determines an object to which it can refer
other arguments in support of this principle have been attemptedsuch as that from the contingent nature of a phenomenon but when this argument is considered we can discover no criterion of contingency except the fact of an eventof something happening that is to say the existence which is preceded by the nonexistence of an object and thus we fall back on the very thing to be proved
if the proposition every thinking being is simple is to be proved we keep to the conception of the ego which is simple and to which all thought has a relation
the same is the case with the transcendental proof of the existence of a deity which is based solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitness of the conceptions of an ens realissimum and a necessary being and cannot be attempted in any other manner
this caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of all propositions of reason
when reason employs conceptions alone only one proof of its thesis is possible if any
when therefore the dogmatist advances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition we may be sure that not one of them is conclusive
for if he possessed one which proved the proposition he brings forward to demonstrationas must always be the case with the propositions of pure reasonwhat need is there for any more his intention can only be similar to that of the advocate who had different arguments for different judges this availing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments who without going into any profound investigation adopt the view of the case which seems most probable at first sight and decide according to it
the third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a proof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or indirect but always ostensive or direct
the direct or ostensive proof not only establishes the truth of the proposition to be proved but exposes the grounds of its truth the apagogic on the other hand may assure us of the truth of the proposition but it cannot enable us to comprehend the grounds of its possibility
the latter is accordingly rather an auxiliary to an argument than a strictly philosophical and rational mode of procedure
in one respect however they have an advantage over direct proofs from the fact that the mode of arguing by contradiction which they employ renders our understanding of the question more clear and approximates the proof to the certainty of an intuitional demonstration
the true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciences is this
when the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are too various or too profound we try whether or not we may not discover the truth of our cognition from its consequences
the modus ponens of reasoning from the truth of its inferences to the truth of a proposition would be admissible if all the inferences that can be drawn from it are known to be true for in this case there can be only one possible ground for these inferences and that is the true one
but this is a quite impracticable procedure as it surpasses all our powers to discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a proposition
but this mode of reasoning is employed under favour when we wish to prove the truth of an hypothesis in which case we admit the truth of the conclusionwhich is supported by analogythat if all the inferences we have drawn and examined agree with the proposition assumed all other possible inferences will also agree with it
but in this way an hypothesis can never be established as a demonstrated truth
the modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to the unknown proposition is not only a rigorous but a very easy mode of proof
for if it can be shown that but one inference from a proposition is false then the proposition must itself be false
instead then of examining in an ostensive argument the whole series of the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests we need only take the opposite of this proposition and if one inference from it be false then must the opposite be itself false and consequently the proposition which we wished to prove must be true
the apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where it is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an objective cognition
where this is possible it is plain that the opposite of a given proposition may contradict merely the subjective conditions of thought and not the objective cognition or it may happen that both propositions contradict each other only under a subjective condition which is incorrectly considered to be objective and as the condition is itself false both propositions may be false and it will consequently be impossible to conclude the truth of the one from the falseness of the other
in mathematics such subreptions are impossible and it is in this science accordingly that the indirect mode of proof has its true place
in the science of nature where all assertion is based upon empirical intuition such subreptions may be guarded against by the repeated comparison of observations but this mode of proof is of little value in this sphere of knowledge
but the transcendental efforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the subjective which is the real medium of all dialectical illusion and thus reason endeavours in its premisses to impose upon us subjective representations for objective cognitions
in the transcendental sphere of pure reason then and in the case of synthetical propositions it is inadmissible to support a statement by disproving the counterstatement
for only two cases are possible either the counterstatement is nothing but the enouncement of the inconsistency of the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of reason which does not affect the real case for example we cannot comprehend the unconditioned necessity of the existence of a being and hence every speculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed on subjective grounds while the possibility of this being in itself cannot with justice be denied or both propositions being dialectical in their nature are based upon an impossible conception
in this latter case the rule applies non entis nulla sunt predicata that is to say what we affirm and what we deny respecting such an object are equally untrue and the apagogic mode of arriving at the truth is in this case impossible
if for example we presuppose that the world of sense is given in itself in its totality it is false either that it is infinite or that it is finite and limited in space
both are false because the hypothesis is false
for the notion of phenomena as mere representations which are given in themselves as objects is selfcontradictory and the infinitude of this imaginary whole would indeed be unconditioned but would be inconsistent as everything in the phenomenal world is conditioned with the unconditioned determination and finitude of quantities which is presupposed in our conception
the apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which have always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical philosophy
it may be compared to a champion who maintains the honour and claims of the party he has adopted by offering battle to all who doubt the validity of these claims and the purity of that honour while nothing can be proved in this way except the respective strength of the combatants and the advantage in this respect is always on the side of the attacking party
spectators observing that each party is alternately conqueror and conquered are led to regard the subject of dispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon
but such an opinion cannot be justified and it is sufficient to apply to these reasoners the remark
non defensoribus istis tempus eget
each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction of the grounds of proof employed in his argument and thus enable us to see in what way the claims of reason may be supported
if an opponent bases his assertions upon subjective grounds he may be refuted with ease not however to the advantage of the dogmatist who likewise depends upon subjective sources of cognition and is in like manner driven into a corner by his opponent
but if parties employ the direct method of procedure they will soon discover the difficulty nay the impossibility of proving their assertions and will be forced to appeal to prescription and precedence or they will by the help of criticism discover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had been mocked and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions to speculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of its proper spherethat of practical principles
chapter ii
the canon of pure reason
it is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it is incompetent to discover truth by means of pure speculation but on the contrary stands in need of discipline to check its deviations from the straight path and to expose the illusions which it originates
but on the other hand this consideration ought to elevate and to give it confidence for this discipline is exercised by itself alone and it is subject to the censure of no other power
the bounds moreover which it is forced to set to its speculative exercise form likewise a check upon the fallacious pretensions of opponents and thus what remains of its possessions after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed is secure from attack or usurpation
the greatest and perhaps the only use of all philosophy of pure reason is accordingly of a purely negative character
it is not an organon for the extension but a discipline for the determination of the limits of its exercise and without laying claim to the discovery of new truth it has the modest merit of guarding against error
at the same time there must be some source of positive cognitions which belong to the domain of pure reason and which become the causes of error only from our mistaking their true character while they form the goal towards which reason continually strives
how else can we account for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find a firm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world of experience it hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge in which it has the deepest interest
it enters upon the path of pure speculation but in vain
we have some reason however to expect that in the only other way that lies open to itthe path of practical reasonit may meet with better success
i understand by a canon a list of the priori principles of the proper employment of certain faculties of cognition
thus general logic in its analytical department is a formal canon for the faculties of understanding and reason
in the same way transcendental analytic was seen to be a canon of the pure understanding for it alone is competent to enounce true priori synthetical cognitions
but when no proper employment of a faculty of cognition is possible no canon can exist
but the synthetical cognition of pure speculative reason is as has been shown completely impossible
there cannot therefore exist any canon for the speculative exercise of this facultyfor its speculative exercise is entirely dialectical and consequently transcendental logic in this respect is merely a discipline and not a canon
if then there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of pure reasonin which case there must be a canon for this facultythis canon will relate not to the speculative but to the practical use of reason
this canon we now proceed to investigate
section i
of the ultimate end of the pure use of reason
there exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venture beyond the field of experience to attempt to reach the utmost bounds of all cognition by the help of ideas alone and not to rest satisfied until it has fulfilled its course and raised the sum of its cognitions into a selfsubsistent systematic whole
is the motive for this endeavour to be found in its speculative or in its practical interests alone
setting aside at present the results of the labours of pure reason in its speculative exercise i shall merely inquire regarding the problems the solution of which forms its ultimate aim whether reached or not and in relation to which all other aims are but partial and intermediate
these highest aims must from the nature of reason possess complete unity otherwise the highest interest of humanity could not be successfully promoted
the transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things the freedom of the will the immortality of the soul and the existence of god
the speculative interest which reason has in those questions is very small and for its sake alone we should not undertake the labour of transcendental investigationa labour full of toil and ceaseless struggle
we should be loth to undertake this labour because the discoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in the sphere of concrete or physical investigation
we may find out that the will is free but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible cause of our volition
as regards the phenomena or expressions of this will that is our actions we are bound in obedience to an inviolable maxim without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere of experience to explain these in the same way as we explain all the other phenomena of nature that is to say according to its unchangeable laws
we may have discovered the spirituality and immortality of the soul but we cannot employ this knowledge to explain the phenomena of this life nor the peculiar nature of the future because our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and does not add anything to our knowledge and the only inferences to be drawn from it are purely fictitious
if again we prove the existence of a supreme intelligence we should be able from it to make the conformity to aims existing in the arrangement of the world comprehensible but we should not be justified in deducing from it any particular arrangement or disposition or inferring any where it is not perceived
for it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of reason that we must not overlook natural causes or refuse to listen to the teaching of experience for the sake of deducing what we know and perceive from something that transcends all our knowledge
in one word these three propositions are for the speculative reason always transcendent and cannot be employed as immanent principles in relation to the objects of experience they are consequently of no use to us in this sphere being but the valueless results of the severe but unprofitable efforts of reason
if then the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions is perfectly useless while reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce us to admit them it is plain that their real value and importance relate to our practical and not to our speculative interest
i term all that is possible through free will practical
but if the conditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical reason can have only a regulative and not a constitutive influence upon it and is serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical laws
in the moral philosophy of prudence for example the sole business of reason is to bring about a union of all the ends which are aimed at by our inclinations into one ultimate endthat of happinessand to show the agreement which should exist among the means of attaining that end
in this sphere accordingly reason cannot present to us any other than pragmatical laws of free action for our guidance towards the aims set up by the senses and is incompetent to give us laws which are pure and determined completely priori
on the other hand pure practical laws the ends of which have been given by reason entirely priori and which are not empirically conditioned but are on the contrary absolutely imperative in their nature would be products of pure reason
such are the moral laws and these alone belong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason and admit of a canon
all the powers of reason in the sphere of what may be termed pure philosophy are in fact directed to the three abovementioned problems alone
these again have a still higher endthe answer to the question what we ought to do if the will is free if there is a god and a future world
now as this problem relates to our in reference to the highest aim of humanity it is evident that the ultimate intention of nature in the constitution of our reason has been directed to the moral alone
we must take care however in turning our attention to an object which is foreign to the sphere of transcendental philosophy not to injure the unity of our system by digressions nor on the other hand to fail in clearness by saying too little on the new subject of discussion
i hope to avoid both extremes by keeping as close as possible to the transcendental and excluding all psychological that is empirical elements
all practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain and consequentlyin an indirect manner at leastto objects of feeling
but as feeling is not a faculty of representation but lies out of the sphere of our powers of cognition the elements of our judgements in so far as they relate to pleasure or pain that is the elements of our practical judgements do not belong to transcendental philosophy which has to do with pure priori cognitions alone
i have to remark in the first place that at present i treat of the conception of freedom in the practical sense only and set aside the corresponding transcendental conception which cannot be employed as a ground of explanation in the phenomenal world but is itself a problem for pure reason
a will is purely animal arbitrium brutum when it is determined by sensuous impulses or instincts only that is when it is determined in a pathological manner
a will which can be determined independently of sensuous impulses consequently by motives presented by reason alone is called a free will arbitrium liberum and everything which is connected with this free will either as principle or consequence is termed practical
the existence of practical freedom can be proved from experience alone
for the human will is not determined by that alone which immediately affects the senses on the contrary we have the power by calling up the notion of what is useful or hurtful in a more distant relation of overcoming the immediate impressions on our sensuous faculty of desire
but these considerations of what is desirable in relation to our whole state that is is in the end good and useful are based entirely upon reason
this faculty accordingly enounces laws which are imperative or objective laws of freedom and which tell us what ought to take place thus distinguishing themselves from the laws of nature which relate to that which does take place
the laws of freedom or of free will are hence termed practical laws
whether reason is not itself in the actual delivery of these laws determined in its turn by other influences and whether the action which in relation to sensuous impulses we call free may not in relation to higher and more remote operative causes really form a part of naturethese are questions which do not here concern us
they are purely speculative questions and all we have to do in the practical sphere is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has to present
experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical freedom as one of the causes which exist in nature that is it shows the causal power of reason in the determination of the will
the idea of transcendental freedom on the contrary requires that reasonin relation to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomenashould be independent of all sensuous determining causes and thus it seems to be in opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience
it therefore remains a problem for the human mind
but this problem does not concern reason in its practical use and we have therefore in a canon of pure reason to do with only two questions which relate to the practical interest of pure reason is there a god and is there a future life the question of transcendental freedom is purely speculative and we may therefore set it entirely aside when we come to treat of practical reason
besides we have already discussed this subject in the antinomy of pure reason
section ii
of the ideal of the summum bonum as a determining ground of the ultimate end of pure reason
reason conducted us in its speculative use through the field of experience and as it can never find complete satisfaction in that sphere from thence to speculative ideaswhich however in the end brought us back again to experience and thus fulfilled the purpose of reason in a manner which though useful was not at all in accordance with our expectations
it now remains for us to consider whether pure reason can be employed in a practical sphere and whether it will here conduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason as we have just stated them
we shall thus ascertain whether from the point of view of its practical interest reason may not be able to supply us with that which on the speculative side it wholly denies us
the whole interest of reason speculative as well as practical is centred in the three following questions
what can i know
what ought i to do
what may i hope
the first question is purely speculative
we have as i flatter myself exhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible and have at last found the reply with which reason must content itself and with which it ought to be content so long as it pays no regard to the practical
but from the two great ends to the attainment of which all these efforts of pure reason were in fact directed we remain just as far removed as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at the outset
so far then as knowledge is concerned thus much at least is established that in regard to those two problems it lies beyond our reach
the second question is purely practical
as such it may indeed fall within the province of pure reason but still it is not transcendental but moral and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our criticism
the third question if i act as i ought to do what may i then hopeis at once practical and theoretical
the practical forms a clue to the answer of the theoretical andin its highest formspeculative question
for all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in precisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality as knowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature
the former arrives finally at the conclusion that something is which determines the ultimate end because something ought to take place the latter that something is which operates as the highest cause because something does take place
happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires extensive in regard to their multiplicity intensive in regard to their degree and protensive in regard to their duration
the practical law based on the motive of happiness i term a pragmatical law or prudential rule but that law assuming such to exist which has no other motive than the worthiness of being happy i term a moral or ethical law
the first tells us what we have to do if we wish to become possessed of happiness the second dictates how we ought to act in order to deserve happiness
the first is based upon empirical principles for it is only by experience that i can learn either what inclinations exist which desire satisfaction or what are the natural means of satisfying them
the second takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfying them and regards only the freedom of a rational being and the necessary conditions under which alone this freedom can harmonize with the distribution of happiness according to principles
this second law may therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure reason and may be cognized priori
i assume that there are pure moral laws which determine entirely priori without regard to empirical motives that is to happiness the conduct of a rational being or in other words to use which it makes of its freedom and that these laws are absolutely imperative not merely hypothetically on the supposition of other empirical ends and therefore in all respects necessary
i am warranted in assuming this not only by the arguments of the most enlightened moralists but by the moral judgement of every man who will make the attempt to form a distinct conception of such a law
pure reason then contains not indeed in its speculative but in its practical or more strictly its moral use principles of the possibility of experience of such actions namely as in accordance with ethical precepts might be met with in the history of man
for since reason commands that such actions should take place it must be possible for them to take place and hence a particular kind of systematic unitythe moralmust be possible
we have found it is true that the systematic unity of nature could not be established according to speculative principles of reason because while reason possesses a causal power in relation to freedom it has none in relation to the whole sphere of nature and while moral principles of reason can produce free actions they cannot produce natural laws
it is then in its practical but especially in its moral use that the principles of pure reason possess objective reality
i call the world a moral world in so far as it may be in accordance with all the ethical lawswhich by virtue of the freedom of reasonable beings it can be and according to the necessary laws of morality it ought to be
but this world must be conceived only as an intelligible world inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions ends and even of all impediments to morality the weakness or pravity of human nature
so far then it is a mere ideathough still a practical ideawhich may have and ought to have an influence on the world of sense so as to bring it as far as possible into conformity with itself
the idea of a moral world has therefore objective reality not as referring to an object of intelligible intuitionfor of such an object we can form no conception whateverbut to the world of senseconceived however as an object of pure reason in its practical useand to a corpus mysticum of rational beings in it in so far as the liberum arbitrium of the individual is placed under and by virtue of moral laws in complete systematic unity both with itself and with the freedom of all others
that is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason which relate to its practical interest do that which will render thee worthy of happiness
the second question is this if i conduct myself so as not to be unworthy of happiness may i hope thereby to obtain happiness in order to arrive at the solution of this question we must inquire whether the principles of pure reason which prescribe priori the law necessarily also connect this hope with it
i say then that just as the moral principles are necessary according to reason in its practical use so it is equally necessary according to reason in its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground to hope for happiness in the measure in which he has made himself worthy of it in his conduct and that therefore the system of morality is inseparably though only in the idea of pure reason connected with that of happiness
now in an intelligible that is in the moral world in the conception of which we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality sensuous desires such a system of happiness connected with and proportioned to morality may be conceived as necessary because freedom of volitionpartly incited and partly restrained by moral lawswould be itself the cause of general happiness and thus rational beings under the guidance of such principles would be themselves the authors both of their own enduring welfare and that of others
but such a system of selfrewarding morality is only an idea the carrying out of which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he ought in other words that all actions of reasonable beings be such as they would be if they sprung from a supreme will comprehending in or under itself all particular wills
but since the moral law is binding on each individual in the use of his freedom of volition even if others should not act in conformity with this law neither the nature of things nor the causality of actions and their relation to morality determine how the consequences of these actions will be related to happiness and the necessary connection of the hope of happiness with the unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness cannot be cognized by reason if we take nature alone for our guide
this connection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of nature is a supreme reason which governs according to moral laws
i term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfect will united with supreme blessedness is the cause of all happiness in the world so far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality as the worthiness of being happy the ideal of the supreme good
it is only then in the ideal of the supreme original good that pure reason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection of both elements of the highest derivative good and accordingly of an intelligible that is moral world
now since we are necessitated by reason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world while the senses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena we must assume the former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense since the world of sense gives us no hint of it and therefore as future in relation to us
thus god and a future life are two hypotheses which according to the principles of pure reason are inseparable from the obligation which this reason imposes upon us
morality per se constitutes a system
but we can form no system of happiness except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to morality
but this is only possible in the intelligible world under a wise author and ruler
such a ruler together with life in such a world which we must look upon as future reason finds itself compelled to assume or it must regard the moral laws as idle dreams since the necessary consequence which this same reason connects with them must without this hypothesis fall to the ground
hence also the moral laws are universally regarded as commands which they could not be did they not connect priori adequate consequences with their dictates and thus carry with them promises and threats
but this again they could not do did they not reside in a necessary being as the supreme good which alone can render such a teleological unity possible
leibnitz termed the world when viewed in relation to the rational beings which it contains and the moral relations in which they stand to each other under the government of the supreme good the kingdom of grace and distinguished it from the kingdom of nature in which these rational beings live under moral laws indeed but expect no other consequences from their actions than such as follow according to the course of nature in the world of sense
to view ourselves therefore as in the kingdom of grace in which all happiness awaits us except in so far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions which render us unworthy of happiness is a practically necessary idea of reason
practical laws in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions that is subjective principles are termed maxims
the judgements of moral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framed according ideas the observance of its laws according to maxims
the whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims but this is impossible unless with the moral law which is a mere idea reason connects an efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is in conformity with the moral law an issue either in this or in another life which is in exact conformity with our highest aims
thus without a god and without a world invisible to us now but hoped for the glorious ideas of morality are indeed objects of approbation and of admiration but cannot be the springs of purpose and action
for they do not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being and which are determined priori by pure reason itself and necessary
happiness alone is in the view of reason far from being the complete good
reason does not approve of it however much inclination may desire it except as united with desert
on the other hand morality alone and with it mere desert is likewise far from being the complete good
to make it complete he who conducts himself in a manner not unworthy of happiness must be able to hope for the possession of happiness
even reason unbiased by private ends or interested considerations cannot judge otherwise if it puts itself in the place of a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others
for in the practical idea both points are essentially combined though in such a way that participation in happiness is rendered possible by the moral disposition as its condition and not conversely the moral disposition by the prospect of happiness
for a disposition which should require the prospect of happiness as its necessary condition would not be moral and hence also would not be worthy of complete happinessa happiness which in the view of reason recognizes no limitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct
happiness therefore in exact proportion with the morality of rational beings whereby they are made worthy of happiness constitutes alone the supreme good of a world into which we absolutely must transport ourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason
this world is it is true only an intelligible world for of such a systematic unity of ends as it requires the world of sense gives us no hint
its reality can be based on nothing else but the hypothesis of a supreme original good
in it independent reason equipped with all the sufficiency of a supreme cause founds maintains and fulfils the universal order of things with the most perfect teleological harmony however much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense
this moral theology has the peculiar advantage in contrast with speculative theology of leading inevitably to the conception of a sole perfect and rational first cause whereof speculative theology does not give us any indication on objective grounds far less any convincing evidence
for we find neither in transcendental nor in natural theology however far reason may lead us in these any ground to warrant us in assuming the existence of one only being which stands at the head of all natural causes and on which these are entirely dependent
on the other hand if we take our stand on moral unity as a necessary law of the universe and from this point of view consider what is necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and for us obligatory force we must come to the conclusion that there is one only supreme will which comprehends all these laws in itself
for how under different wills should we find complete unity of ends this will must be omnipotent that all nature and its relation to morality in the world may be subject to it omniscient that it may have knowledge of the most secret feelings and their moral worth omnipresent that it may be at hand to supply every necessity to which the highest weal of the world may give rise eternal that this harmony of nature and liberty may never fail and so on
but this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligenceswhich as mere nature is only a world of sense but as a system of freedom of volition may be termed an intelligible that is moral world regnum gratiaeleads inevitably also to the teleological unity of all things which constitute this great whole according to universal natural lawsjust as the unity of the former is according to universal and necessary moral lawsand unites the practical with the speculative reason
the world must be represented as having originated from an idea if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we cannot even consider ourselves as worthy of reasonnamely the moral use which rests entirely on the idea of the supreme good
hence the investigation of nature receives a teleological direction and becomes in its widest extension physicotheology
but this taking its rise in moral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom and not accidentally instituted by external commands establishes the teleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparably connected with the internal possibility of things
this gives rise to a transcendental theology which takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity and this principle connects all things according to universal and necessary natural laws because all things have their origin in the absolute necessity of the one only primal being
what use can we make of our understanding even in respect of experience if we do not propose ends to ourselves but the highest ends are those of morality and it is only pure reason that can give us the knowledge of these
though supplied with these and putting ourselves under their guidance we can make no teleological use of the knowledge of nature as regards cognition unless nature itself has established teleological unity
for without this unity we should not even possess reason because we should have no school for reason and no cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its conceptions
but teleological unity is a necessary unity and founded on the essence of the individual will itself
hence this will which is the condition of the application of this unity in concreto must be so likewise
in this way the transcendental enlargement of our rational cognition would be not the cause but merely the effect of the practical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us
hence also we find in the history of human reason that before the moral conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined and before men had attained to a perception of the systematic unity of ends according to these conceptions and from necessary principles the knowledge of nature and even a considerable amount of intellectual culture in many other sciences could produce only rude and vague conceptions of the deity sometimes even admitting of an astonishing indifference with regard to this question altogether
but the more enlarged treatment of moral ideas which was rendered necessary by the extreme pure moral law of our religion awakened the interest and thereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object
in this way and without the help either of an extended acquaintance with nature or of a reliable transcendental insight for these have been wanting in all ages a conception of the divine being was arrived at which we now hold to be the correct one not because speculative reason convinces us of its correctness but because it accords with the moral principles of reason
thus it is to pure reason but only in its practical use that we must ascribe the merit of having connected with our highest interest a cognition of which mere speculation was able only to form a conjecture but the validity of which it was unable to establishand of having thereby rendered it not indeed a demonstrated dogma but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends of reason
but if practical reason has reached this elevation and has attained to the conception of a sole primal being as the supreme good it must not therefore imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions of its application and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects it must not presume to start from the conception which it has gained and to deduce from it the moral laws themselves
for it was these very laws the internal practical necessity of which led us to the hypothesis of an independent cause or of a wise ruler of the universe who should give them effect
hence we are not entitled to regard them as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler especially as we have no conception of such a will except as formed in accordance with these laws
so far then as practical reason has the right to conduct us we shall not look upon actions as binding on us because they are the commands of god but we shall regard them as divine commands because we are internally bound by them
we shall study freedom under the teleological unity which accords with principles of reason we shall look upon ourselves as acting in conformity with the divine will only in so far as we hold sacred the moral law which reason teaches us from the nature of actions themselves and we shall believe that we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the universe in ourselves and in others
moral theology is therefore only of immanent use
it teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world by placing ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends and warns us against the fanaticism nay the crime of depriving reason of its legislative authority in the moral conduct of life for the purpose of directly connecting this authority with the idea of the supreme being
for this would be not an immanent but a transcendent use of moral theology and like the transcendent use of mere speculation would inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason
section iii
of opinion knowledge and belief
the holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding which may rest on objective grounds but requires also subjective causes in the mind of the person judging
if a judgement is valid for every rational being then its ground is objectively sufficient and it is termed a conviction
if on the other hand it has its ground in the particular character of the subject it is termed a persuasion
persuasion is a mere illusion the ground of the judgement which lies solely in the subject being regarded as objective
hence a judgement of this kind has only private validityis only valid for the individual who judges and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be communicated
but truth depends upon agreement with the object and consequently the judgements of all understandings if true must be in agreement with each other consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter se
conviction may therefore be distinguished from an external point of view from persuasion by the possibility of communicating it and by showing its validity for the reason of every man for in this case the presumption at least arises that the agreement of all judgements with each other in spite of the different characters of individuals rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each with the object and thus the correctness of the judgement is established
persuasion accordingly cannot be subjectively distinguished from conviction that is so long as the subject views its judgement simply as a phenomenon of its own mind
but if we inquire whether the grounds of our judgement which are valid for us produce the same effect on the reason of others as on our own we have then the means though only subjective means not indeed of producing conviction but of detecting the merely private validity of the judgement in other words of discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion
if we can in addition to this develop the subjective causes of the judgement which we have taken for its objective grounds and thus explain the deceptive judgement as a phenomenon in our mind apart altogether from the objective character of the object we can then expose the illusion and need be no longer deceived by it although if its subjective cause lies in our nature we cannot hope altogether to escape its influence
i can only maintain that is affirm as necessarily valid for every one that which produces conviction
persuasion i may keep for myself if it is agreeable to me but i cannot and ought not to attempt to impose it as binding upon others
holding for true or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation to conviction which is at the same time objectively valid has the three following degrees opinion belief and knowledge
opinion is a consciously insufficient judgement subjectively as well as objectively
belief is subjectively sufficient but is recognized as being objectively insufficient
knowledge is both subjectively and objectively sufficient
subjective sufficiency is termed conviction for myself objective sufficiency is termed certainty for all
i need not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple conceptions
i must never venture to be of opinion without knowing something at least by which my judgement in itself merely problematical is brought into connection with the truthwhich connection although not perfect is still something more than an arbitrary fiction
moreover the law of such a connection must be certain
for if in relation to this law i have nothing more than opinion my judgement is but a play of the imagination without the least relation to truth
in the judgements of pure reason opinion has no place
for as they do not rest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that of necessary truth and priori cognition the principle of connection in it requires universality and necessity and consequently perfect certaintyotherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all
hence it is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics we must know or abstain from forming a judgement altogether
the case is the same with the maxims of morality
for we must not hazard an action on the mere opinion that it is allowed but we must know it to be so
in the transcendental sphere of reason on the other hand the term opinion is too weak while the word knowledge is too strong
from the merely speculative point of view therefore we cannot form a judgement at all
for the subjective grounds of a judgement such as produce belief cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries inasmuch as they cannot stand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated to others in equal measure
but it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically insufficient judgement can be termed belief
now the practical reference is either to skill or to morality to the former when the end proposed is arbitrary and accidental to the latter when it is absolutely necessary
if we propose to ourselves any end whatever the conditions of its attainment are hypothetically necessary
the necessity is subjectively but still only comparatively sufficient if i am acquainted with no other conditions under which the end can be attained
on the other hand it is sufficient absolutely and for every one if i know for certain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions under which the attainment of the proposed end would be possible
in the former case my suppositionmy judgement with regard to certain conditionsis a merely accidental belief in the latter it is a necessary belief
the physician must pursue some course in the case of a patient who is in danger but is ignorant of the nature of the disease
he observes the symptoms and concludes according to the best of his judgement that it is a case of phthisis
his belief is even in his own judgement only contingent another man might perhaps come nearer the truth
such a belief contingent indeed but still forming the ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certain ends i term pragmatical belief
the usual test whether that which any one maintains is merely his persuasion or his subjective conviction at least that is his firm belief is a bet
it frequently happens that a man delivers his opinions with so much boldness and assurance that he appears to be under no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error
the offer of a bet startles him and makes him pause
sometimes it turns out that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat but not at ten
for he does not hesitate perhaps to venture a ducat but if it is proposed to stake ten he immediately becomes aware of the possibility of his being mistakena possibility which has hitherto escaped his observation
if we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the happiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition our judgement drops its air of triumph we take the alarm and discover the actual strength of our belief
thus pragmatical belief has degrees varying in proportion to the interests at stake
now in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action in reference to some object and where accordingly our judgement is purely theoretical we can still represent to ourselves in thought the possibility of a course of action for which we suppose that we have sufficient grounds if any means existed of ascertaining the truth of the matter
thus we find in purely theoretical judgements an analogon of practical judgements to which the word belief may properly be applied and which we may term doctrinal belief
i should not hesitate to stake my all on the truth of the propositionif there were any possibility of bringing it to the test of experiencethat at least some one of the planets which we see is inhabited
hence i say that i have not merely the opinion but the strong belief on the correctness of which i would stake even many of the advantages of life that there are inhabitants in other worlds
now we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of god belongs to doctrinal belief
for although in respect to the theoretical cognition of the universe i do not require to form any theory which necessarily involves this idea as the condition of my explanation of the phenomena which the universe presents but on the contrary am rather bound so to use my reason as if everything were mere nature still teleological unity is so important a condition of the application of my reason to nature that it is impossible for me to ignore itespecially since in addition to these considerations abundant examples of it are supplied by experience
but the sole condition so far as my knowledge extends under which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things according to the wisest ends
consequently the hypothesis of a wise author of the universe is necessary for my guidance in the investigation of natureis the condition under which alone i can fulfil an end which is contingent indeed but by no means unimportant
moreover since the result of my attempts so frequently confirms the utility of this assumption and since nothing decisive can be adduced against it it follows that it would be saying far too little to term my judgement in this case a mere opinion and that even in this theoretical connection i may assert that i firmly believe in god
still if we use words strictly this must not be called a practical but a doctrinal belief which the theology of nature physicotheology must also produce in my mind
in the wisdom of a supreme being and in the shortness of life so inadequate to the development of the glorious powers of human nature we may find equally sufficient grounds for a doctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul
the expression of belief is in such cases an expression of modesty from the objective point of view but at the same time of firm confidence from the subjective
if i should venture to term this merely theoretical judgement even so much as a hypothesis which i am entitled to assume a more complete conception with regard to another world and to the cause of the world might then be justly required of me than i am in reality able to give
for if i assume anything even as a mere hypothesis i must at least know so much of the properties of such a being as will enable me not to form the conception but to imagine the existence of it
but the word belief refers only to the guidance which an idea gives me and to its subjective influence on the conduct of my reason which forces me to hold it fast though i may not be in a position to give a speculative account of it
but mere doctrinal belief is to some extent wanting in stability
we often quit our hold of it in consequence of the difficulties which occur in speculation though in the end we inevitably return to it again
it is quite otherwise with moral belief
for in this sphere action is absolutely necessary that is i must act in obedience to the moral law in all points
the end is here incontrovertibly established and there is only one condition possible according to the best of my perception under which this end can harmonize with all other ends and so have practical validitynamely the existence of a god and of a future world
i know also to a certainty that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions which conduct to the same unity of ends under the moral law
but since the moral precept is at the same time my maxim as reason requires that it should be i am irresistibly constrained to believe in the existence of god and in a future life and i am sure that nothing can make me waver in this belief since i should thereby overthrow my moral maxims the renunciation of which would render me hateful in my own eyes
thus while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyond the limits of experience end in disappointment there is still enough left to satisfy us in a practical point of view
no one it is true will be able to boast that he knows that there is a god and a future life for if he knows this he is just the man whom i have long wished to find
all knowledge regarding an object of mere reason can be communicated and i should thus be enabled to hope that my own knowledge would receive this wonderful extension through the instrumentality of his instruction
no my conviction is not logical but moral certainty and since it rests on subjective grounds of the moral sentiment i must not even say it is morally certain that there is a god etc
but i am morally certain that is my belief in god and in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that i am under as little apprehension of having the former torn from me as of losing the latter
the only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion is that this rational belief presupposes the existence of moral sentiments
if we give up this assumption and take a man who is entirely indifferent with regard to moral laws the question which reason proposes becomes then merely a problem for speculation and may indeed be supported by strong grounds from analogy but not by such as will compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way
but in these questions no man is free from all interest
for though the want of good sentiments may place him beyond the influence of moral interests still even in this case enough may be left to make him fear the existence of god and a future life
for he cannot pretend to any certainty of the nonexistence of god and of a future life unlesssince it could only be proved by mere reason and therefore apodeicticallyhe is prepared to establish the impossibility of both which certainly no reasonable man would undertake to do
this would be a negative belief which could not indeed produce morality and good sentiments but still could produce an analogon of these by operating as a powerful restraint on the outbreak of evil dispositions
the human mind as i believe every rational being must of necessity do takes a natural interest in morality although this interest is not undivided and may not be practically in preponderance
if you strengthen and increase it you will find the reason become docile more enlightened and more capable of uniting the speculative interest with the practical
but if you do not take care at the outset or at least midway to make men good you will never force them into an honest belief
but it will be said is this all that pure reason can effect in opening up prospects beyond the limits of experience nothing more than two articles of belief common sense could have done as much as this without taking the philosophers to counsel in the matter
i shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which the laborious efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reasoneven granting that its merit should turn out in the end to be only negativefor on this point something more will be said in the next section
but i ask do you require that that knowledge which concerns all men should transcend the common understanding and should only be revealed to you by philosophers the very circumstance which has called forth your censure is the best confirmation of the correctness of our previous assertions since it discloses what could not have been foreseen that nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution of her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction and that in respect to the essential ends of human nature we cannot advance further with the help of the highest philosophy than under the guidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding
chapter iii
the architectonic of pure reason
by the term architectonic i mean the art of constructing a system
without systematic unity our knowledge cannot become science it will be an aggregate and not a system
thus architectonic is the doctrine of the scientific in cognition and therefore necessarily forms part of our methodology
reason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected and rhapsodistic state but requires that the sum of our cognitions should constitute a system
it is thus alone that they can advance the ends of reason
by a system i mean the unity of various cognitions under one idea
this idea is the conceptiongiven by reasonof the form of a whole in so far as the conception determines priori not only the limits of its content but the place which each of its parts is to occupy
the scientific idea contains therefore the end and the form of the whole which is in accordance with that end
the unity of the end to which all the parts of the system relate and through which all have a relation to each other communicates unity to the whole system so that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from our knowledge of the rest and it determines priori the limits of the system thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions
the whole is thus an organism articulatio and not an aggregate coacervatio it may grow from within per intussusceptionem but it cannot increase by external additions per appositionem
it is thus like an animal body the growth of which does not add any limb but without changing their proportions makes each in its sphere stronger and more active
we require for the execution of the idea of a system a schema that is a content and an arrangement of parts determined priori by the principle which the aim of the system prescribes
a schema which is not projected in accordance with an idea that is from the standpoint of the highest aim of reason but merely empirically in accordance with accidental aims and purposes the number of which cannot be predetermined can give us nothing more than technical unity
but the schema which is originated from an idea in which case reason presents us with aims priori and does not look for them to experience forms the basis of architectonical unity
a science in the proper acceptation of that term cannot be formed technically that is from observation of the similarity existing between different objects and the purely contingent use we make of our knowledge in concreto with reference to all kinds of arbitrary external aims its constitution must be framed on architectonical principles that is its parts must be shown to possess an essential affinity and be capable of being deduced from one supreme and internal aim or end which forms the condition of the possibility of the scientific whole
the schema of a science must give priori the plan of it monogramma and the division of the whole into parts in conformity with the idea of the science and it must also distinguish this whole from all others according to certain understood principles
no one will attempt to construct a science unless he have some idea to rest on as a proper basis
but in the elaboration of the science he finds that the schema nay even the definition which he at first gave of the science rarely corresponds with his idea for this idea lies like a germ in our reason its parts undeveloped and hid even from microscopical observation
for this reason we ought to explain and define sciences not according to the description which the originator gives of them but according to the idea which we find based in reason itself and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of the science already accumulated
for it will of ten be found that the originator of a science and even his latest successors remain attached to an erroneous idea which they cannot render clear to themselves and that they thus fail in determining the true content the articulation or systematic unity and the limits of their science
it is unfortunate that only after having occupied ourselves for a long time in the collection of materials under the guidance of an idea which lies undeveloped in the mind but not according to any definite plan of arrangementnay only after we have spent much time and labour in the technical disposition of our materials does it become possible to view the idea of a science in a clear light and to project according to architectonical principles a plan of the whole in accordance with the aims of reason
systems seem like certain worms to be formed by a kind of generatio aequivocaby the mere confluence of conceptions and to gain completeness only with the progress of time
but the schema or germ of all lies in reason and thus is not only every system organized according to its own idea but all are united into one grand system of human knowledge of which they form members
for this reason it is possible to frame an architectonic of all human cognition the formation of which at the present time considering the immense materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems would not indeed be very difficult
our purpose at present is merely to sketch the plan of the architectonic of all cognition given by pure reason and we begin from the point where the main root of human knowledge divides into two one of which is reason
by reason i understand here the whole higher faculty of cognition the rational being placed in contradistinction to the empirical
if i make complete abstraction of the content of cognition objectively considered all cognition is from a subjective point of view either historical or rational
historical cognition is cognitio ex datis rational cognitio ex principiis
whatever may be the original source of a cognition it is in relation to the person who possesses it merely historical if he knows only what has been given him from another quarter whether that knowledge was communicated by direct experience or by instruction
thus the person who has learned a system of philosophysay the wolfianalthough he has a perfect knowledge of all the principles definitions and arguments in that philosophy as well as of the divisions that have been made of the system possesses really no more than an historical knowledge of the wolfian system he knows only what has been told him his judgements are only those which he has received from his teachers
dispute the validity of a definition and he is completely at a loss to find another
he has formed his mind on anothers but the imitative faculty is not the productive
his knowledge has not been drawn from reason and although objectively considered it is rational knowledge subjectively it is merely historical
he has learned this or that philosophy and is merely a plaster cast of a living man
rational cognitions which are objective that is which have their source in reason can be so termed from a subjective point of view only when they have been drawn by the individual himself from the sources of reason that is from principles and it is in this way alone that criticism or even the rejection of what has been already learned can spring up in the mind
all rational cognition is again based either on conceptions or on the construction of conceptions
the former is termed philosophical the latter mathematical
i have already shown the essential difference of these two methods of cognition in the first chapter
a cognition may be objectively philosophical and subjectively historicalas is the case with the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the limits of their system and who remain in a state of pupilage all their lives
but it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge when committed to memory is valid from the subjective point of view as rational knowledge also and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here as in the case of philosophical cognition
the reason is that the only way of arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles of reason and thus it is always certain and indisputable because reason is employed in concretobut at the same time priorithat is in pure and therefore infallible intuition and thus all causes of illusion and error are excluded
of all the priori sciences of reason therefore mathematics alone can be learned
philosophyunless it be in an historical mannercannot be learned we can at most learn to philosophize
philosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition
we must use this term in an objective sense if we understand by it the archetype of all attempts at philosophizing and the standard by which all subjective philosophies are to be judged
in this sense philosophy is merely the idea of a possible science which does not exist in concreto but to which we endeavour in various ways to approximate until we have discovered the right path to pursuea path overgrown by the errors and illusions of senseand the image we have hitherto tried in vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great prototype
until that time we cannot learn philosophyit does not exist if it does where is it who possesses it and how shall we know it we can only learn to philosophize in other words we can only exercise our powers of reasoning in accordance with general principles retaining at the same time the right of investigating the sources of these principles of testing and even of rejecting them
until then our conception of philosophy is only a scholastic conceptiona conception that is of a system of cognition which we are trying to elaborate into a science all that we at present know being the systematic unity of this cognition and consequently the logical completeness of the cognition for the desired end
but there is also a cosmical conception conceptus cosmicus of philosophy which has always formed the true basis of this term especially when philosophy was personified and presented to us in the ideal of a philosopher
in this view philosophy is the science of the relation of all cognition to the ultimate and essential aims of human reason teleologia rationis humanae and the philosopher is not merely an artistwho occupies himself with conceptionsbut a lawgiver legislating for human reason
in this sense of the word it would be in the highest degree arrogant to assume the title of philosopher and to pretend that we had reached the perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone
the mathematician the natural philosopher and the logicianhow far soever the first may have advanced in rational and the two latter in philosophical knowledgeare merely artists engaged in the arrangement and formation of conceptions they cannot be termed philosophers
above them all there is the ideal teacher who employs them as instruments for the advancement of the essential aims of human reason
him alone can we call philosopher but he nowhere exists
but the idea of his legislative power resides in the mind of every man and it alone teaches us what kind of systematic unity philosophy demands in view of the ultimate aims of reason
this idea is therefore a cosmical conception
by a cosmical conception i mean one in which all men necessarily take an interest the aim of a science must accordingly be determined according to scholastic conceptions if it is regarded merely as a means to certain arbitrarily proposed ends
in view of the complete systematic unity of reason there can only be one ultimate end of all the operations of the mind
to this all other aims are subordinate and nothing more than means for its attainment
this ultimate end is the destination of man and the philosophy which relates to it is termed moral philosophy
the superior position occupied by moral philosophy above all other spheres for the operations of reason sufficiently indicates the reason why the ancients always included the ideaand in an especial mannerof moralist in that of philosopher
even at the present day we call a man who appears to have the power of selfgovernment even although his knowledge may be very limited by the name of philosopher
the legislation of human reason or philosophy has two objectsnature and freedomand thus contains not only the laws of nature but also those of ethics at first in two separate systems which finally merge into one grand philosophical system of cognition
the philosophy of nature relates to that which is that of ethics to that which ought to be
but all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason or the cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles
the former is termed pure the latter empirical philosophy
the philosophy of pure reason is either propdeutic that is an inquiry into the powers of reason in regard to pure priori cognition and is termed critical philosophy or it is secondly the system of pure reasona science containing the systematic presentation of the whole body of philosophical knowledge true as well as illusory given by pure reasonand is called metaphysic
this name may however be also given to the whole system of pure philosophy critical philosophy included and may designate the investigation into the sources or possibility of priori cognition as well as the presentation of the priori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophyexcluding at the same time all empirical and mathematical elements
metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the practical use of pure reason and is accordingly either the metaphysic of nature or the metaphysic of ethics
the former contains all the pure rational principlesbased upon conceptions alone and thus excluding mathematicsof all theoretical cognition the latter the principles which determine and necessitate priori all action
now moral philosophy alone contains a code of lawsfor the regulation of our actionswhich are deduced from principles entirely priori
hence the metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy as it is not based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations
the metaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysic in the more limited sense
but as pure moral philosophy properly forms a part of this system of cognition we must allow it to retain the name of metaphysic although it is not requisite that we should insist on so terming it in our present discussion
it is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions which differ from others both in kind and in origin and to take great care that they are not confounded with those with which they are generally found connected
what the chemist does in the analysis of substances what the mathematician in pure mathematics is in a still higher degree the duty of the philosopher that the value of each different kind of cognition and the part it takes in the operations of the mind may be clearly defined
human reason has never wanted a metaphysic of some kind since it attained the power of thought or rather of reflection but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thought and cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements
the idea of a science of this kind is as old as speculation itself and what mind does not speculateeither in the scholastic or in the popular fashion at the same time it must be admitted that even thinkers by profession have been unable clearly to explain the distinction between the two elements of our cognitionthe one completely priori the other posteriori and hence the proper definition of a peculiar kind of cognition and with it the just idea of a science which has so long and so deeply engaged the attention of the human mind has never been established
when it was said metaphysic is the science of the first principles of human cognition this definition did not signalize a peculiarity in kind but only a difference in degree these first principles were thus declared to be more general than others but no criterion of distinction from empirical principles was given
of these some are more general and therefore higher than others andas we cannot distinguish what is completely priori from that which is known to be posterioriwhere shall we draw the line which is to separate the higher and socalled first principles from the lower and subordinate principles of cognition what would be said if we were asked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world into the earlier centuries and those following them does the fifth or the tenth century belong to the earlier centuries it would be asked
in the same way i ask does the conception of extension belong to metaphysics you answer yes
well that of body too yes
and that of a fluid body you stop you are unprepared to admit this for if you do everything will belong to metaphysics
from this it is evident that the mere degree of subordinationof the particular to the generalcannot determine the limits of a science and that in the present case we must expect to find a difference in the conceptions of metaphysics both in kind and in origin
the fundamental idea of metaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind of priori cognition showed a certain similarity in character with the science of mathematics
both have the property in common of possessing an priori origin but in the one our knowledge is based upon conceptions in the other on the construction of conceptions
thus a decided dissimilarity between philosophical and mathematical cognition comes outa dissimilarity which was always felt but which could not be made distinct for want of an insight into the criteria of the difference
and thus it happened that as philosophers themselves failed in the proper development of the idea of their science the elaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim or under trustworthy guidance
thus too philosophers ignorant of the path they ought to pursue and always disputing with each other regarding the discoveries which each asserted he had made brought their science into disrepute with the rest of the world and finally even among themselves
all pure priori cognition forms therefore in view of the peculiar faculty which originates it a peculiar and distinct unity and metaphysic is the term applied to the philosophy which attempts to represent that cognition in this systematic unity
the speculative part of metaphysic which has especially appropriated this appellationthat which we have called the metaphysic of natureand which considers everything as it is not as it ought to be by means of priori conceptions is divided in the following manner
metaphysic in the more limited acceptation of the term consists of two partstranscendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason
the former presents the system of all the conceptions and principles belonging to the understanding and the reason and which relate to objects in general but not to any particular given objects ontologia the latter has nature for its subjectmatter that is the sum of given objectswhether given to the senses or if we will to some other kind of intuitionand is accordingly physiology although only rationalis
but the use of the faculty of reason in this rational mode of regarding nature is either physical or hyperphysical or more properly speaking immanent or transcendent
the former relates to nature in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied in experience in concreto the latter to that connection of the objects of experience which transcends all experience
transcendent physiology has again an internal and an external connection with its object both however transcending possible experience the former is the physiology of nature as a whole or transcendental cognition of the world the latter of the connection of the whole of nature with a being above nature or transcendental cognition of god
immanent physiology on the contrary considers nature as the sum of all sensuous objects consequently as it is presented to usbut still according to priori conditions for it is under these alone that nature can be presented to our minds at all
the objects of immanent physiology are of two kinds
those of the external senses or corporeal nature
the object of the internal sense the soul or in accordance with our fundamental conceptions of it thinking nature
the metaphysics of corporeal nature is called physics but as it must contain only the principles of an priori cognition of nature we must term it rational physics
the metaphysics of thinking nature is called psychology and for the same reason is to be regarded as merely the rational cognition of the soul
thus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts
ontology
rational physiology
rational cosmology and
rational theology
the second partthat of the rational doctrine of naturemay be subdivided into two physica rationalis and psychologia rationalis
it must not be supposed that i mean by this appellation what is generally called physica general is and which is rather mathematics than a philosophy of nature
for the metaphysic of nature is completely different from mathematics nor is it so rich in results although it is of great importance as a critical test of the application of pure understandingcognition to nature
for want of its guidance even mathematicians adopting certain common notionswhich are in fact metaphysicalhave unconsciously crowded their theories of nature with hypotheses the fallacy of which becomes evident upon the application of the principles of this metaphysic without detriment however to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of cognition
the fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessity dictates this division it is therefore architectonicalin accordance with the highest aims of reason and not merely technical or according to certain accidentallyobserved similarities existing between the different parts of the whole science
for this reason also is the division immutable and of legislative authority
but the reader may observe in it a few points to which he ought to demur and which may weaken his conviction of its truth and legitimacy
in the first place how can i desire an priori cognition or metaphysic of objects in so far as they are given posteriori and how is it possible to cognize the nature of things according to priori principles and to attain to a rational physiology the answer is this
we take from experience nothing more than is requisite to present us with an object in general of the external or of the internal sense in the former case by the mere conception of matter impenetrable and inanimate extension in the latter by the conception of a thinking beinggiven in the internal empirical representation i think
as to the rest we must not employ in our metaphysic of these objects any empirical principles which add to the content of our conceptions by means of experience for the purpose of forming by their help any judgements respecting these objects
secondly what place shall we assign to empirical psychology which has always been considered a part of metaphysics and from which in our time such important philosophical results have been expected after the hope of constructing an priori system of knowledge had been abandoned i answer it must be placed by the side of empirical physics or physics proper that is must be regarded as forming a part of applied philosophy the priori principles of which are contained in pure philosophy which is therefore connected although it must not be confounded with psychology
empirical psychology must therefore be banished from the sphere of metaphysics and is indeed excluded by the very idea of that science
in conformity however with scholastic usage we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysicsbut only as an appendix to it
we adopt this course from motives of economy as psychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as an independent study while it is at the same time of too great importance to be entirely excluded or placed where it has still less affinity than it has with the subject of metaphysics
it is a stranger who has been long a guest and we make it welcome to stay until it can take up a more suitable abode in a complete system of anthropologythe pendant to empirical physics
the above is the general idea of metaphysics which as more was expected from it than could be looked for with justice and as these pleasant expectations were unfortunately never realized fell into general disrepute
our critique must have fully convinced the reader that although metaphysics cannot form the foundation of religion it must always be one of its most important bulwarks and that human reason which naturally pursues a dialectical course cannot do without this science which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and by elevating reason to a scientific and clear selfknowledge prevents the ravages which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit in the sphere of morals as well as in that of religion
we may be sure therefore whatever contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by those who judge a science not by its own nature but according to the accidental effects it may have produced that it can never be completely abandoned that we must always return to it as to a beloved one who has been for a time estranged because the questions with which it is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity and reason must always labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these or to destroy those which others have already established
metaphysic thereforethat of nature as well as that of ethics but in an especial manner the criticism which forms the propdeutic to all the operations of reasonforms properly that department of knowledge which may be termed in the truest sense of the word philosophy
the path which it pursues is that of science which when it has once been discovered is never lost and never misleads
mathematics natural science the common experience of men have a high value as means for the most part to accidental endsbut at last also to those which are necessary and essential to the existence of humanity
but to guide them to this high goal they require the aid of rational cognition on the basis of pure conceptions which be it termed as it may is properly nothing but metaphysics
for the same reason metaphysics forms likewise the completion of the culture of human reason
in this respect it is indispensable setting aside altogether the influence which it exerts as a science
for its subjectmatter is the elements and highest maxims of reason which form the basis of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all
that as a purely speculative science it is more useful in preventing error than in the extension of knowledge does not detract from its value on the contrary the supreme office of censor which it occupies assures to it the highest authority and importance
this office it administers for the purpose of securing order harmony and wellbeing to science and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to the highest possible aimthe happiness of all mankind
chapter iv
the history of pure reason
this title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating a division of the system of pure reason of which i do not intend to treat at present
i shall content myself with casting a cursory glance from a purely transcendental point of viewthat of the nature of pure reasonon the labours of philosophers up to the present time
they have aimed at erecting an edifice of philosophy but to my eye this edifice appears to be in a very ruinous condition
it is very remarkable although naturally it could not have been otherwise that in the infancy of philosophy the study of the nature of god and the constitution of a future world formed the commencement rather than the conclusion as we should have it of the speculative efforts of the human mind
however rude the religious conceptions generated by the remains of the old manners and customs of a less cultivated time the intelligent classes were not thereby prevented from devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence and nature of god and they easily saw that there could be no surer way of pleasing the invisible ruler of the world and of attaining to happiness in another world at least than a good and honest course of life in this
thus theology and morals formed the two chief motives or rather the points of attraction in all abstract inquiries
but it was the former that especially occupied the attention of speculative reason and which afterwards became so celebrated under the name of metaphysics
i shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which the greatest changes in metaphysics took place but shall merely give a hasty sketch of the different ideas which occasioned the most important revolutions in this sphere of thought
there are three different ends in relation to which these revolutions have taken place
in relation to the object of the cognition of reason philosophers may be divided into sensualists and intellectualists
epicurus may be regarded as the head of the former plato of the latter
the distinction here signalized subtle as it is dates from the earliest times and was long maintained
the former asserted that reality resides in sensuous objects alone and that everything else is merely imaginary the latter that the senses are the parents of illusion and that truth is to be found in the understanding alone
the former did not deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind of reality but with them it was merely logical with the others it was mystical
the former admitted intellectual conceptions but declared that sensuous objects alone possessed real existence
the latter maintained that all real objects were intelligible and believed that the pure understanding possessed a faculty of intuition apart from sense which in their opinion served only to confuse the ideas of the understanding
in relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason we find one school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience and another that they have their origin in reason alone
aristotle may be regarded as the head of the empiricists and plato of the noologists
locke the follower of aristotle in modern times and leibnitz of plato although he cannot be said to have imitated him in his mysticism have not been able to bring this question to a settled conclusion
the procedure of epicurus in his sensual system in which he always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience was much more consequent than that of aristotle and locke
the latter especially after having derived all the conceptions and principles of the mind from experience goes so far in the employment of these conceptions and principles as to maintain that we can prove the existence of god and the existence of god and the immortality of them objects lying beyond the soulboth of them of possible experiencewith the same force of demonstration as any mathematical proposition
in relation to method
method is procedure according to principles
we may divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiry into the naturalistic and the scientific
the naturalist of pure reason lays it down as his principle that common reason without the aid of sciencewhich he calls sound reason or common sensecan give a more satisfactory answer to the most important questions of metaphysics than speculation is able to do
he must maintain therefore that we can determine the content and circumference of the moon more certainly by the naked eye than by the aid of mathematical reasoning
but this system is mere misology reduced to principles and what is the most absurd thing in this doctrine the neglect of all scientific means is paraded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition
as regards those who are naturalists because they know no better they are certainly not to be blamed
they follow common sense without parading their ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret how we are to find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well of democritus
quod sapio satis est mihi non ego curo esse quod arcesilas aerumnosiquesolones
persius satirae iii
is their motto under which they may lead a pleasant and praiseworthy life without troubling themselves with science or troubling science with them
as regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method they have now the choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical while they are bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure
when i mention in relation to the former the celebrated wolf and as regards the latter david hume i may leave in accordance with my present intention all others unnamed
the critical path alone is still open
if my reader has been kind and patient enough to accompany me on this hitherto untravelled route he can now judge whether if he and others will contribute their exertions towards making this narrow footpath a high road of thought that which many centuries have failed to accomplish may not be executed before the close of the presentnamely to bring reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which has always but without permanent results occupied her powers and engaged her ardent desire for knowledge
